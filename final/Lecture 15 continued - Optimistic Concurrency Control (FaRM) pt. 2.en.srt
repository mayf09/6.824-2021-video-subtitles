1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,780
Okay, good afternoon, good evening or good night, good morning,

2
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,050
whatever timezone you're in watching this lecture.

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:19,450
Double checking on sound, people can hear me?

4
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,490
Yes.

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,420
Yes.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,770
Sure, okay, I'm gonna talk about two things today,

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,380
I want to finish off our discussion to FaRM,

8
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,360
and then I'll talk about Spark.

9
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,390
And just to remind everybody else,

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,030
so everybody, we were more FaRM,

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,470
we're talked about executing transaction without any failures,

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,140
and we looked at one example,

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,230
of whether actually the transaction provided external consistency or strict serializability.

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,170
And, so I want to talk about one more example,

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,200
to look about, to talk about serializability,

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,230
and then talk a little bit about fault tolerance,

17
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,970
but before doing so,

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,380
it's probably helpful to remind,

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,210
remind ourselves exactly you know how transaction works,

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,730
if there are no failures.

21
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,640
And so in FaRM application goes for two phases,

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,220
the execution phase, where it fetches objects you know from different shards,

23
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,350
and then the commit phase.

24
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,930
And so we look back at this picture here,

25
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,000
you know there's an execution phase,

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,310
three objects being, three objects being read,

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,310
you know one from each different shard,

28
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,220
you know we have shard one, shard two and shard three,

29
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,440
and every shard has one backup,

30
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,780
so this system could tolerate one failure.

31
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,210
So object to read, the the two objects are being modified,

32
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,340
as we see in the second,

33
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,230
and then once you know the three objects read and two modified,

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,330
the application might decide to commit,

35
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,910
and then so the whole commit phase goes into action,

36
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,180
this whole story from steps one through five,

37
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,750
and in step one, the transaction takes of locks

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,360
on the objects that have been written written,

39
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,620
so we see here,

40
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,840
there have been two objects that have been written to by the transaction,

41
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,270
and so we're propagating what's called lock records you know to every primary,

42
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,220
so every primary is going to have a lock record for this transaction,

43
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,190
and for the objects involved in the transaction,

44
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,600
so and lock records contains an object id,

45
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,700
which identifies the object uniquely,

46
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,990
a version number,

47
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,800
so at the time that transaction reads an object,

48
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,900
it gets back a version number,

49
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,780
in fact gets back this 64 bit number,

50
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,620
which is top is a lock bit and the rest is version number,

51
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,130
and then a new value.

52
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,810
So, you know primary 1 and primary 2 is going to have,

53
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,940
primary 1 is going to have to lock record for object 1,

54
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,780
primary 2 is going to have to lock object for primary for object 2,

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,810
then there's a separate phase for the validation of the read-only operations

56
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,460
or operations were objects that have only read, but not modified,

57
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,310
as we can see in those validation step,

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,000
the dotted lines represent one-sided RDMAs,

59
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,070
and as we talked about on Tuesday,

60
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,620
those basically involve no server involvement,

61
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,230
you know sender can just read an object out of the memory of the server,

62
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,430
without actually have,

63
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,120
without actually having to interrupt the computation, that's actually running on the server,

64
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,460
so they tend to be very fast,

65
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,400
unlike you know these operations that we saw here,

66
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,470
which are actually write RDMAs,

67
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,380
they are cool too,

68
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,320
in the sense, that you get to write you know to the

69
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,330
appends you know to this log record

70
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,980
without actually interrupting the server,

71
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,710
but the server actually has to process these log records,

72
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,230
and and the server in this case,

73
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,330
once it actually process one of these log records,

74
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,430
you know tries to take the lock,

75
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,500
if it succeeds trying to take the lock,

76
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,360
because the version number hasn't changed

77
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,870
or to the lock bit or no other transactions taking the lock,

78
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,640
then it will reply back,

79
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,720
you know using another one of write RDMA saying ok.

80
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,020
And so yeah we see that on the acquiring lock,

81
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,670
requires action on the server,

82
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,390
but the one-sided RDMA for reads validation,

83
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,220
doesn't require any action on the server.

84
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,740
Then, there's the,

85
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,220
if everything turns out to be okay,

86
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,600
so, transactions basically able to obtain those write locks

87
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,660
and validate you know the read operations,

88
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,690
it actually makes a decision to commit

89
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,880
and to commit, it a first communicates to every backup,

90
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,480
the object the change,

91
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,270
so write to commit backup record,

92
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,020
it depends that to every, to the backups of the objects that have been modified,

93
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,620
again you know it's basically a copy of the lock record,

94
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,220
you know oid goes in there the version number goes in there and the new value.

95
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:47,830
Once you know all the backups you know have have reported,

96
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,020
that they actually have a copy of the object,

97
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,880
now we're basically in pretty good shape,

98
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,180
because the primary has copy, the backup has copy,

99
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,740
[] the primary doesn't really know,

100
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,140
if the transaction has been committed yet or not,

101
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,570
and so the final step is that,

102
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:08,890
actually the coordinator or transaction coordinator write out and commit a record,

103
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,880
and commit primary record,

104
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,600
informing the primaries that actually transaction actually has committed.

105
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,690
And as soon as it gets an acknowledgement from one of the NICs,

106
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,550
you know indicated by the dotted lines,

107
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,030
it actually reports back to the application,

108
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,860
saying that the transaction committed.

109
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,960
So what we wanna do now is look at two cases,

110
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,320
one we wanted to talk a little bit more about serializability,

111
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,150
just to see if the concurrency control work out,

112
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,010
and then we'll talk a little bit about fault tolerance,

113
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,660
and see if the fault tolerance story works out.

114
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,490
So let me first start with serializability,

115
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,830
alright, so maybe before doing that,

116
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,400
let me just ask if any questions so far,

117
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,680
or whether everybody should have swapped,

118
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,630
successfully swapped FaRM back into into your memories.

119
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,130
What does the rectangle mean in this?

120
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,400
Sorry?

121
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,680
So what's the rectangle,

122
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,360
what does it signify, along?

123
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,320
It's object.

124
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,490
Oh, it's object, okay.

125
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,540
Okay, any other questions?

126
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,880
Okay, good, let's,

127
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,360
so let's look at the correctness from the concurrency perspective,

128
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,650
so the correct correctness strict serializability.

129
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,790
And on Tuesday, we looked at

130
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,490
transaction that didn't really evolve write validation,

131
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,360
because there was no object was read, but not written,

132
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,910
and so I'm going to look at another transaction this time around,

133
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,190
where actually the validation phase plays a role.

134
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,370
And so we look at two transactions,

135
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,370
and this is sort of,

136
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,580
this example is a classic example

137
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,240
to test whether a protocol provides serializability or not,

138
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,950
of course, it's not going to be approve,

139
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,020
but it's sort of one of these key examples,

140
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,250
generally it's very helpful to see, to understand how the protocol works.

141
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,950
The protocol, the transactions are,

142
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,830
if x is 0, then we're going to set y to 1,

143
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,700
so if object x 0, we'll set object y 1,

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,180
which is transaction 2 sort of the opposite, it looks,

145
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,890
if y is 0, and if y 0, set x to 1.

146
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,430
And the reason of this sort of,

147
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,700
this is a good test for serializability,

148
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,790
is that either transaction 1 should go after T2, correct,

149
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,620
or T2 should go after T1,

150
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,410
and depending on which order you run,

151
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,720
you know either y is 1, or x is 1,

152
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,700
but you never should have,

153
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:09,670
you never should have the outcome said x is 1, oops, the x is 1, and y is 1.

154
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,090
And that should not be allowed,

155
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,730
because definitely violates serializability.

156
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,140
Does that make sense?

157
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,840
Okay, so what do we want to do is

158
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,070
to test whether FaRM is actually successful,

159
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,480
in, we want to understand requirements,

160
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,820
and indeed it is not possible that x is 1 and y is 1 get produced.

161
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,120
So let's look at the timeline,

162
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,880
let's say here we have T1, here we have T2 timeline,

163
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,600
so they both you know in their sort of the preparation or execution phase,

164
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,770
both reads these objects,

165
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,650
so let's say they run through the concurrently,

166
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,230
we do a read of x and version number 0,

167
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,750
we do a read of y, the version number 0,

168
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,830
same here.

169
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,310
And of course T1 will update y, T2 will update x,

170
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,080
and they [] at some point you know those start to commit phase,

171
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,970
and you know let's,

172
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,650
so let's say the T1 that starts first,

173
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:29,540
and basically grabs the, it needs to lock on y,

174
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,850
since it's going to be writing y,

175
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,750
so, let's say x successfully grab the lock on y,

176
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:42,920
and so that actually will set the lock bit and the version number of the y object.

177
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,900
And then let's say you know actually,

178
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,280
since it's going to read,

179
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,540
it has read x,

180
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,480
but it's not as read x,

181
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,510
but it's not modifying x, but the validation of x,

182
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,890
you know x was read version number 0,

183
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,730
the you know at validation phase,

184
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,830
so nothing actually has changed with x,

185
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,110
that version number still 0 there,

186
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,210
you know we're executed in this order,

187
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,420
and so things are sort of are fine,

188
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,680
and you know at some point, you know this transaction might commit.

189
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,650
So let's look at T2,

190
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,740
let's say you know T2 runs after the validation of x,

191
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,090
so it grabs the lock,

192
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:36,470
and and then you know the, it has read y,

193
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,300
so it needs to do a validation of y,

194
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,590
that's going to do a validation of y,

195
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,110
and the question is,

196
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,200
is that validation could succeed or not.

197
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,420
No, because the previous the other operation has the lock modified value,

198
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,820
so it's not the same, that was originally read.

199
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,910
Yeah, so the version numbers might be still the same,

200
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:07,040
but y, you know T1 has set the lock bit, right, for the object y,

201
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,470
and so at this point, this validation will fail,

202
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,940
because it's not the same, or the lock bit has been set,

203
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,090
so to T2 transaction, the T2 transaction will abort.

204
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,400
Okay, does that makes sense?

205
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,820
So we see at least in this particular example,

206
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,340
that you know it is the case,

207
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,440
that T1 and T2 both commit,

208
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,900
which would result in this incorrect outcome.

209
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,090
Any questions about this?

210
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,740
I I had a question.

211
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,250
Yeah.

212
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,480
Yeah, so, like for for the transactions,

213
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,100
so these are like these have to be like update transaction,

214
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,500
like rewrite, correct,

215
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,570
just read, it couldn't do it.

216
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,180
Yeah, go ahead.

217
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,670
I I just wonder,

218
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,310
if they were like read operations,

219
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,530
you could do that, like lock-free, right,

220
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,000
and as long as the.

221
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,680
Yeah, so this is actually,

222
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,510
let's go back to this picture here, right,

223
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,890
then let's look at the,

224
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,400
let's say, there were no writes involved in this transaction at all, right,

225
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,830
so for example the two objects have been read, correct,

226
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,780
store at you know P1 and P2.

227
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,440
So let's assume that these guys are actually not involved,

228
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,090
so those objects were not written,

229
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,660
so the only operation that's happening is read with that object.

230
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,180
And you see in and so the protocols carefully designed,

231
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,460
so that if you only do reads,

232
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,250
you only do one-sided RDMAs, correct,

233
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,940
here in the execution phase

234
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,100
and one RDMA to do the validation,

235
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,060
and no locks are taken out,

236
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,410
no writes are being done,

237
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,000
no records are being appended,

238
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,590
that's the only thing that happens.

239
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,450
And so this is one of the cool features about FaRM,

240
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,320
is that these transactions that only do reads,

241
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,720
can be executed without, with only one-sided RDMAs,

242
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:11,710
and only with no writes to any locks or grabbing locks,

243
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,920
and so that's why one reason that they get extremely high performance.

244
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,650
And this is also the reason why,

245
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:23,560
for example the lock phase, the lock step and validation steps are two separate things,

246
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,940
because in for read-only transactions, there's no lock step.

247
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,660
Okay?

248
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,720
Actually, a question on that,

249
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,050
for read-only transactions,

250
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,180
why do we need the second,

251
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,040
why do we need the validation phase,

252
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,990
because aren't you like reading a value,

253
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,140
and then you're immediately validating right after it like the version,

254
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:47,890
it seems like.

255
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,530
It could be another transaction, that has been has modified the object yet,

256
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,270
so if transaction ran or started and committed before,

257
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,180
okay, the concurrent transaction actual writes might modify the object,

258
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,190
and now, we'll be back, right,

259
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:12,340
so the the the transaction writes,

260
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,890
then the transaction that actually follows

261
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,230
you know should you know see observed at last write.

262
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,870
But if they occur at the same time,

263
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,970
then we can reorder them either way.

264
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,650
Exactly at the same time, we order reorder them, yeah.

265
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,650
So it still seems to me,

266
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,720
like the second validation,

267
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,100
because the first time you read it,

268
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,090
the second time you just immediately [] and see the version is the same [],

269
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:46,030
it still seems to me like the second validation is like almost unnecessary.

270
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,370
I I, you might be right,

271
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,780
I haven't thought very hard about this,

272
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:55,840
that if there, if there are transactions are only read-only transactions,

273
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,180
you know then the validation is definitely not necessary,

274
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,280
I have very carefully thought about,

275
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,840
when there's a mix of transactions,

276
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,000
where there is a case where you need the validation.

277
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,420
Yeah, what would that be the case,

278
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,450
where like you have like, if you read a value,

279
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,840
like you expect to read like two values atomically,

280
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,480
read value, after you read a value,

281
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,450
like some transaction modifies the other value.

282
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,790
Yeah, it would be one possible.

283
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,360
When it doesn't.

284
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,970
Yeah, sure, I'm not, I'm not quite sure,

285
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,430
actually in that case, if that's the problem.

286
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,500
Like, for example in this case,

287
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,240
you know this T1 and T2 cases,

288
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,390
really crucial that y actually does the validation, correct,

289
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:50,220
even though actually that transaction you know T1 only reads y, right.

290
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,950
But what if, transaction 2 was just x equals 1,

291
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,530
instead of like without that statement.

292
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,340
Blind write.

293
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,620
Hmm?

294
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,360
If it is a blind write.

295
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,250
Yeah, it's just x equals 1

296
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,210
and then it executes after the validation of T1.

297
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,430
Yeah, that's fine, correct.

298
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,650
But whould.

299
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,910
I'm not sure what the question is.

300
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,420
Oh, so if T2 is is just,

301
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,240
like like you know write x equals 1,

302
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,610
within the validation step,

303
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,810
after an excuse, after the validation step of T1,

304
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,520
wouldn't then T1 think that x equals 0,

305
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,210
but then x becomes 1 before the commit.

306
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,400
Okay, so okay, let me, maybe we can make a hold up,

307
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,190
because I gotta redraw the whole picture,

308
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,440
and figure out exactly what the scenario you're talking about.

309
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,610
Okay, so maybe we can go back to this at the end.

310
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,320
Sorry, I had a question,

311
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,960
what is the use case for normal transaction?

312
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:13,510
If think back Spanner and this paper,

313
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,550
like there's often the case,

314
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,350
in these workloads, the TPC-C workload and the TATP workload,

315
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,860
where you know there's a transaction that only does reads for example,

316
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,200
I've computed the balances of a set of accounts,

317
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,420
nothing is being written,

318
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,700
but you know a lot of things, a lot of accounts being read.

319
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,630
Thank you.

320
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,600
Okay, so we see here there's actually a validation phase is crucial, correct,

321
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,050
T1 and T2 transaction,

322
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,350
in in [], that actually things are work out, correct,

323
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,670
we get strict serializability,

324
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,810
of course this is not a proof,

325
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,480
but it gives you you know this example

326
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,540
to try to get at the tricky case,

327
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,180
you know actually FaRM seems to work out correctly.

328
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,500
Okay so, so that's on the concurrency control,

329
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,630
then the second part,

330
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,480
we want to talk a little bit about is fault tolerance.

331
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,320
And you gone want to get the, not gonna go great amount of depth here,

332
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,640
just want to talk about the you know key challenge,

333
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,210
and see you know and build some intuition,

334
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:31,050
why we might actually be hopeful that FaRM actually addresses the key challenge.

335
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,530
And so the key challenge,

336
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,760
and so we actually have the key challenge is that,

337
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:46,700
there's actually crashes after telling the application,

338
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,890
and then it has to be the case, right,

339
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,170
that the transaction persists,

340
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,140
because we have informed the application that the transaction is committed,

341
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:08,000
so we can't actually lose any writes that the transaction has done.

342
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,940
And so we can look at this picture again,

343
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,650
and see if we're,

344
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,630
going to be hopeful that this is the case,

345
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,320
so you know there are a couple things to observe,

346
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,260
after you know the lock phase,

347
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,940
it is the case that,

348
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,250
after the lock phase,

349
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:40,110
it's the case, that the two primaries P1 and P2 have a lock record,

350
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,070
which describes the update,

351
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,110
we don't really know the transaction,

352
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,980
that record doesn't say whether the record actually,

353
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,290
whether the transaction is committed,

354
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,690
but we have information about the transaction,

355
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,830
then, after this step, to commit backup step,

356
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:06,370
we know that you know backup B1 and B2 have the commit record,

357
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,110
and then before you know the transaction,

358
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,830
the transaction coordinator reports to the application,

359
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,290
that it has to be successful,

360
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,600
we know that one of the primaries,

361
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,450
let's say P1 also has commit record,

362
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,190
so you know let's assume there's a crash you know like right here,

363
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,750
so at that particular just after that commit point, you know the system crashes,

364
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,420
and what we want to convince ourselves off is that,

365
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,000
if there's one failure,

366
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,240
like for each shard, things actually work out correct,

367
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,230
and so the worst case basically correct is the B2 fails,

368
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,910
so here, where is B2 you know B2 B2 fails,

369
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,340
and so we lose you know that commit record,

370
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,600
that is actually there,

371
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,560
the primary might actually have not a commit record yet,

372
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:16,580
because you know it crashed after we see if the acknowledgement of one primary,

373
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,460
so let's say that P1 must actually have to commit record,

374
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,730
so in this case, P1 have commit record,

375
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,550
and you know and of course you know the backup has commit record for B1,

376
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,750
so this is enough information, correct, for convince during recovery,

377
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,850
that actually the transaction has committed,

378
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,220
because you know we have a commit record,

379
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,620
which is just what the tid that's committed,

380
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,010
and we actually have all the information at the backups,

381
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,440
namely the lock, the commit records which describe the write transactions,

382
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,240
on the backups,

383
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,680
and so during recovery,

384
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,720
we actually have enough information to decide

385
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,730
you know that the transaction actually has committed.

386
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,930
And so that's sufficient,

387
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,550
you know of course there's a complex protocol,

388
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,960
that actually needs to go into action,

389
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,410
and sort of look at all the pieces that are left behind by the transaction,

390
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,240
with enough pieces left behind transaction,

391
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,790
for the coordinator, for the new coordinator, the recovery process to decide that,

392
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,120
actually this transaction indeed has committed and should be persistent.

393
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,960
Okay?

394
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,340
Good.

395
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,700
So let me summarize FaRM

396
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,810
and before we jump into the discussion of Spark.

397
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,920
So you know top level,

398
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,430
you know what's so cool about FaRM is fast,

399
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,520
it can execute many many, many transactions per second,

400
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,240
you know there are some restrictions of course you know on FaRM,

401
00:23:54,270 --> 00:24:00,690
you can't do it all all the time.

402
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,120
So, first of all,

403
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,430
it assume few conflicts,

404
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,150
so use this optimistic concurrency control scheme,

405
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,390
and the reason that uses this optimistic concurrency control scheme,

406
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,830
because want to take out locks,

407
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,200
because it wants to do this one-sided RDMA,

408
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,240
without actually any server involvement.

409
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,770
So using optimistic concurrency control scheme,

410
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,580
that means that, if you want a good performance

411
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,670
and avoid transaction aborts that workload better,

412
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,590
actually, have few conflicts,

413
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,090
we're seeing new innovation,

414
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,070
there are two common benchmarks

415
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,490
that are being used in the transaction literature to measure systems,

416
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,440
for those two benchmarks,

417
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,380
you know clearly as doing extremely well,

418
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,350
does mean they're not that many conflicts.

419
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,270
The second assumption, it makes is that,

420
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,920
the data must fit in memory,

421
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,710
so it means that if you have a really really big database,

422
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,000
you have to buy more machines,

423
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,870
or if you're really the data too big

424
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,160
and you don't want to buy more machines,

425
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,750
then basically you can't use FaRM,

426
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,540
and you have to go back to more traditional database,

427
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,460
that actually has you know persistent storage,

428
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:22,260
and so you can read or write record to a much larger storage device.

429
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:31,410
Replication is only, is only within the data center,

430
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,130
so in that way, in that way,

431
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,770
it's quite different from Spanner,

432
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,330
the whole goal, there was to do,

433
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,680
synchronous transactions across, the synchronous replication across data centers,

434
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,750
you know to support applications,

435
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,280
that need to be able to survive or continue,

436
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,020
while some data centers are down,

437
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,110
indicates you know FaRM that is just not the case,

438
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,690
it's not targeted to those kinds of applications.

439
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,990
And then the final point is,

440
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:14,550
it requires you know pretty fancy or exotic hardware,

441
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,920
in particular has two things,

442
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:23,160
this UPS, [] UPS to survive complete data center outages,

443
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:28,080
and more importantly you know use this RDMA NICs,

444
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,520
you know get actually really high performance.

445
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,830
Okay, that's all I wanted to say about FaRM,

446
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,810
unless there are any further questions.

447
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:06,690
Okay, so that basically ends set of paper or ends transaction side of this 6.824,

448
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,470
so we're sort of done three lectures on transactions,

449
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,700
and that was basically this is the end of talking about transactions,

450
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,380
so will show up in other papers,

451
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,630
but we're not going to talk about any more detail,

452
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,970
in fact we're basically sort of done

453
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,410
with talking about you know sort of the most challenging part in the distributed systems,

454
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,320
namely building fault tolerant storage systems,

455
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,940
and you know we're now seeing a broad spectrum of different designs,

456
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,930
including designs,

457
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:39,240
that they are actually supports very powerful programming abstraction of transactions.

458
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,240
So in the next, this lecture,

459
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,790
the remaining of this lecture and subsequent lectures,

460
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,010
we're going to sort of look at different topics,

461
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,010
that were unrelated to storage systems.

462
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:56,840
And so the first topic, that we're gonna be talking about is Spark.
