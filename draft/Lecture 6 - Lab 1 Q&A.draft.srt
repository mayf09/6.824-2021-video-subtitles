0,90 90,360 390,570 570,720 720,840

0,330 330,510 510,660 660,840 840,1020
time, go to some {Q&As

42
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,710

0,150 150,300 300,480 480,1020 1080,2100
might have right now| and

44
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,720
0,870 900,1770 1770,2010 2010,2160 2160,2910

0,420 420,960 960,1110 1110,1380 1380,1860
So first for the lab

48
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,400
0,570 570,960 960,1950 2040,2670 2670,2760

49
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,350
0,240 240,420 420,1020 1530,1830 1830,1950
know if the fonts too

50
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,730
0,450 450,960 960,1110 1110,1290 1290,1380
small,| I'll just stick with

51
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,680
0,480
this.|

52
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,480
0,300 300,870 900,1560 1560,2850
Alright, so I basically,

53
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,400
0,300 300,570 570,840 840,960 960,1350
{} one step by step,|

54
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,450
0,120 120,240 240,630 630,930 930,1050
and I'll show how I

55
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,430
0,390 390,480 480,1050 1320,1860 1860,1980
developed my solution,| so the

56
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,530
0,270 270,390 390,540 540,1080 1380,2100
first thing I did was,|

57
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,210
0,360 360,690 690,870 870,1170 1170,1410
this is {rpc.go - -

58
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,500
0,420 750,960 960,1020 1020,1200 1200,1290
-}| and the first thing

59
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,090
0,90 90,270 270,720 780,1320 1320,1590
I did was figure out

60
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,380
0,150 150,870 870,1050 1050,1290 1290,1290
the API| in which I

61
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,090
0,480 480,630 630,870 870,1140 1140,1710
wanted my {worker,and -} coordinator

62
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,630
0,120 120,750 1440,1770 1770,2430 3390,3540
to communicate,| and so the

63
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,530
0,210 210,330 330,420 420,720 720,900
first thing I did was

64
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,480
0,720 810,1170 1170,1470 1470,1560 1560,1950
define what types of tasks

65
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,190
0,180 180,570 990,1410 1410,1530 1530,1710
there are| and so there

66
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,660
0,270 270,360 360,660 660,1110 1110,1470
map and reduce tasks| and

67
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,430
0,180 180,540 540,780 780,1320 1320,1770
in order to signal that

68
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,410
0,240 240,840 840,1350 1380,1680 1680,1860
the coordinator has things the

69
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,790
0,240 240,300 300,750 870,1140 1140,1380
job is done, {is,the} done

70
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,600
0,600
task,|

71
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,140
0,210 210,360 360,780 780,960 960,1200
and so, these are the

72
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,640
0,330 330,420 420,990
types of task.|

73
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,290
0,660 660,810 810,900 900,1260 1290,1470
Zoom in a bit, can

74
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,730
0,60 60,330 330,480 480,570 570,1440
you zoom in a bit,

75
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,620
0,720 720,1170
flies.| Yeah,

76
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,920
0,450 450,1110
{is,that} okay?|

77
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,580
0,840 870,1680
Yeah, thanks.|

78
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,440
0,420 510,960 960,1080 1080,1260 1260,1380
Cool, yeah, it's hard for

79
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,000
0,240 240,630 660,1170 1200,1410 1410,1560
me to tell how it

80
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,260
0,750
looked.|

81
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,600
0,420 420,720 720,1530 1530,1740 1740,1860
Yeah, so hopefully this is

82
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,220
0,330 600,1560 2340,3090
good,| {} and

83
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,840
0,360 360,900 900,1140 1140,1350 1350,1500
so the there two {RPCs

84
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,550
0,510 510,660 660,1110 1110,1170 1170,1710
-} I decided to implement,|

85
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,290
0,240 240,630 630,1020 1020,1110 1110,1560
the first is a worker

86
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,670
0,420 420,480 480,1110 1110,1230 1230,1380

0,90 90,180 180,720 870,1110 1110,1290
it a task,| so one

88

0,240 240,510 510,1140 1470,2190 2310,2850
in please exit| and basically

90
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,720
0,240 240,600
there's like

91
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,250
0,90 90,1050 1050,1140 1140,1260 1260,1470
the argument,| you don't really

92
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,320
0,510 630,960 960,1680 1680,1890 1890,2070
have any arguments or just

93
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,540
0,300 300,390 390,450 450,1080 1110,2220
asking for a task| and

94
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,490
0,360 360,930 930,1380 1380,1590 1590,1800
the coordinator replies with what

95
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,290
0,300 300,420 420,930 960,1290 1290,1800

0,150 150,390 390,870 990,1200 1200,1350
of that type should you

97
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,720
0,570
do,|

98
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,340

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,810
0,150 150,390 390,480 480,690 690,1170
the number of map tasks

102
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,040
0,120 120,210 210,780 870,1140 1140,1230
in the system| or the

103
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,700
0,330 330,660 660,1260
number reduce tasks.|

104
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,270
0,570 570,690 690,990 990,1620 1620,1890
And the second RPC is

105
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,310
0,450 480,930 930,1170 1170,1770 1800,2040
a finished task RPC,| that

106
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,780
0,90 90,480 480,870 870,990 990,1470
the worker uses to notify

107
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,550
0,90 90,900 1200,1440 1440,1560 1560,1770
the coordinator,| that it has

108
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,620
0,390 390,540 540,1110 1170,1680 1680,2070
finished the task| {} and

109
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,720
0,450 480,1050 1050,1290 1290,1830 1830,2100
it passes as arguments which

110
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,300
0,360 360,570 570,1140
task has finished,|

111
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,890
0,300 300,420 420,630 630,1170 1170,1440
and they don't actually really

112
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,580
0,180 180,240 240,360 360,390 390,690
need to get a reply

113
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,640
0,120 120,570
for this.|

114
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
0,150 150,300 300,420 420,690 690,1200
So that's the first step

115
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:39,350
0,630 630,720 720,1560 5130,5550 5580,6090
of the implementation,| so hi.|

116
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,840
0,630 630,1050 1050,1230 1230,1320 1320,1650
Alright, so as a second

117
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,190
0,480 510,750 750,870 870,1140 1140,1350
step,| what I did is

118
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,840
0,480 480,570 570,1380 1380,1560 1560,1650
implement the handlers for all

119
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,520
0,210 210,720 720,900 1140,1590 1590,1680
these {RPCs -}| and so

120
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,540
0,300 300,510 510,1380 2550,3420
that's in coordinator,| so,

121
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,590
0,330 330,420 420,600 600,690 690,1020
first I had to actually

122
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,940
0,480 480,570 570,1140 1140,1260 1260,1350
populate the coordinator with the

123
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,010
0,480 480,930 1260,1530 1530,1710 1710,2070
coordinator state| and so there's

124
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,480
0,90 90,630 630,870 870,1350 1350,1470
the mutexes which protects the

125
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,100
0,300 300,450 450,930 930,1350 1350,1620
state from concurrent access,| because

126
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,390
0,90 90,630 630,750 750,930 930,1290
the coordinator will have multiple

127
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,960
0,360 360,840 1620,2490 2790,3480 3480,3570
threads running concurrently,| then the

128
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,180
0,540 600,1440 1440,1800 1800,1920 1920,2220
second part is to keep

129
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,410
0,300 300,420 420,630 630,990 990,1230
track of just like the

130
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,880
0,450 450,570 570,690 690,1050 1050,1470
files that {we,need} {for,map} task|

131
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,990
0,270 270,330 330,630 630,720 720,960
and the number of map

132
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,360
0,90 90,450 450,870
and reduce tasks,|

133
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,170
0,810 1620,1920 1920,2340 2400,3120 3120,3660
and {} this metadata is

134
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,910
0,510 510,630 630,1080 1080,1380 1380,1740
used to track which tasks

135
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,560
0,150 150,270 270,870 1020,1380 1380,1650
have we issued| and which

136
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,770
0,300 300,420 420,1020 1320,2040 2490,3210
tasks have finished,| {} the

137
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,730
0,240 240,330 330,510 510,870 870,930
once that we've issued we

138
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,630
0,240 240,510 510,570 570,660 660,900
keep track of our {timestamps

139
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,130
0,420 420,570 570,660 660,1170 1230,1500
-},| that we know if

140
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,330
0,210 210,480 480,630 630,720 720,1200
these tasks have been completed

141
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,050
0,240 240,300 300,510 510,660 660,720
within a certain amount of

142
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,570
0,270 270,420 420,1080 1080,1470 2340,2520
time to reissue them,| and

143
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,000
0,390 390,540 540,1110 1290,1860 1860,2430
finally we have {} the,|

144
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,980
0,390 390,690 690,1380 1560,1800 1800,1860
like has all, has a

145
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,440
0,480 480,1020 1020,1350 1500,2070
coordinator finished {} boolean.|

146
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,460
0,420 420,570 570,1140 1140,1290 1290,1680
So to handle the get

147
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,630
0,390 390,540 540,930 930,1020 1020,1140
task {RPC -}, we have

148
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,750
0,60 60,690 960,2100 2190,2880 2880,3120
a handler,| that essentially what

149
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,940
0,90 90,630 870,1560 1680,2040 2040,2190
it does is,| it will

150
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,100
0,240 240,330 330,690 690,1440 1710,2160
set the reply fields,| right

151
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,380
0,210 210,390 390,750 750,1290 1410,2280
now, I haven't yet implemented

152
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,880
0,390 390,600 600,810 810,1200 1200,1500
the part, that actually issues

153
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,370
0,90 90,660 1110,1650 1890,2190 2220,2490
the task,| and if all

154
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,450
0,210 210,450 450,570 570,840 840,1080
the map and reduce tasks

155
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,800
0,90 90,600 690,870 870,1020 1020,1350
are done,| it will send

156
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,910
0,210 210,480 480,900 900,990 990,1110
a done task to the

157
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,660
0,510 750,990 990,1320
worker and exit.|

158
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,140
0,750 1110,1290 1290,1440 1440,1560 1560,1950
{} And then we have

159
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,360
0,600 990,1410 1410,1950 1950,2130 2130,2220
the the handler for the

160
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,150
0,510 540,1530 1530,1650 1650,2160 2460,2790
finished task {RPC -}| and

161
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,230
0,150 150,300 300,720 720,930 930,1080
what this does is,| it

162
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,720
0,930 1110,1890 1890,2010 2010,2190 2190,2490
basically depending on what task

163
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,530
0,90 90,570 1200,1680 1680,2310 3090,3810
it was,| set that flag

164
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,910
0,120 120,450 450,750 750,1020 1020,1380
to true,| that has that

165
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,760
0,510 510,690 690,1290
task has finished.|

166
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,020
0,420 420,780 780,840 840,1140 1140,1470
So that's the second step,|

167
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,460
0,270 270,420 420,930 930,1020 1020,1440
which is implementing the handlers

168
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,960
0,120 120,240 240,780 3660,4290 4350,4500
with {RPCs -}.| So the

169
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,310
0,270 270,510 510,600 600,930 930,1350
third step I have is

170
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,890
0,480 480,960 960,1050 1050,1200 1200,1800
actually sending the {RPCs -}|

171
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,480
0,570 810,1020 1020,1470 1740,2460
and so that happened

172
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,060
0,180 180,480 480,1050
is the {work,here}.|

173
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,100
0,1830
So,

174
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,440
0,300
{}

175
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,380
0,330 330,420 420,660 660,990 1290,1680
top of this is,| we

176
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,000
0,540 780,1050 1050,1170 1170,1440 1440,1590
provided what it does is,|

177
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
0,120 120,390 390,510 510,660 660,1200
it starts up this loop,|

178
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,320
0,240 240,1170 1350,1770 1770,2310 2310,2760
that basically for every loop,|

179
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,270
0,180 180,840 930,1140 1140,1560 1560,1950
it calls the handler {for,get}

180
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,000
0,480 810,990 990,1110 1110,1890 2490,2730
task in the coordinator| and

181
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,140
0,420 420,540 540,720 720,1020 1020,1140
depending on what task it

182
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,550
0,330 330,420 420,540 540,1050 1050,1410
gets,| it will either perform

183
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,010
0,270 270,810 990,1230 1230,1680 1920,2460
map task with the relevant

184
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,810
0,420 420,660 660,1080 1080,1290 1290,1800
data| or metadata that needs

185
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,430
0,630 630,720 720,1020 1020,1470 1470,1590
perform the reduce task| or

186
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,360
0,60 60,150 150,390 390,510 510,930
in the case of done,

187
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,420
0,120 120,240 240,630
it will exit.|

188
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,370
0,750 840,1320 1320,1470 1470,1620 1620,1800
{} And so it's very

189
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,360
0,300 300,420 420,570 570,690 690,990
simple| and once it's finished

190
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,040
0,150 150,600 810,1020 1020,1170 1170,1680
that task,| it will send

191
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,140
0,150 150,630 630,1200 1380,1590 1590,2100
a finished task {RPC -}

192
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,620
0,120 120,210 210,930
to the coordinator.|

193
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,910
0,420 420,630 630,750 750,1110 1110,1290
So this is just the

194
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,510
0,780 870,1710 1710,2400 2640,3090 3090,3600
skeleton code for the worker

195
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,120
0,360 360,540 540,1140
sending {RPCs -}.|

196
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,790
0,240 240,360 360,450 450,540 540,690
Alright, so we have {RPCs

197
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,320
0,540 540,630 630,780 780,1320 1320,1530
-}, we have handlers, {we,have}

198
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,940
0,60 60,630 840,1230 1230,1320 1320,1620
the senders,| and so now,

199
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,800
0,210 210,750 750,1230 1230,1350 1350,1860
let's actually implement some stuff.|

200
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,320
0,810 3660,3840 3840,4110 4110,4680 4710,5100
So in step four, it's

201
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,750
0,210 210,390 390,750 750,1110 1170,1410
I just added a ton

202
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,940
0,270 330,990 990,1440 1470,1950 1950,2190
of handlers to manage this

203
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,400
0,630 630,1050 1650,2100 2100,2370 2370,2460
intermediate file,| {} which a

204
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,780
0,180 180,240 240,600 600,900 900,1380
lot of you also did|

205
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,880
0,450 450,930 930,1170 1170,1440 1440,1680
and basically it uses like

206
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,410
0,150 150,420 420,1110 1110,1320 1320,1530
{} {os.Rename -},| it gets

207
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,410
0,240 240,690 690,1320 2490,2790 2790,3000
a temporary file,| so it's

208
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,570
0,210 210,480 480,1140 1740,1980 1980,2160
not too interesting| and then

209
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,310
0,90 90,360 360,960 990,1290 1290,1740
the next step, let's actually

210
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,020
0,840 960,1200 1200,1290 1290,1380 1380,1710
implement some of the worker

211
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,560
0,870 1410,2130
functionality.| So,

212
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,930
0,120 120,330 330,390 390,480 480,1050
we're back in the worker,|

213
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,670
0,600 600,960 960,1230 1230,1680 1680,1770
and now let's implement the

214
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,540
0,480 480,690 690,1260
{performMap -} function,|

215
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,280
0,450 450,690 690,870 870,1350 1350,2010
and what this does is

216
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,050
0,330 330,630 630,810 810,990 990,1200
as many you have to

217
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,880
0,360 360,690 720,1050 1050,1140 1140,1830
do is| read the file,

218
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,070
0,660 660,810 810,900 900,1740 1800,2160
map them to keys| and

219
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,110
0,450 450,780 780,1110 1110,1770 1770,2040
then create temporary files, write

220
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,360
0,330 330,930 1080,1230 1230,1710 1710,2250
them to the intermediate files,|

221
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,830
0,150 150,540 570,720 720,900 900,1470
and then we use an

222
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,200
0,540 540,1140 1170,1470 1470,1950 1950,2340
atomic rename| to ensure that

223
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,060
0,420 420,630 630,1140 1140,1320 1320,1680
maps aren't conflicting as they

224
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,290
0,480 480,540 540,870 870,1020 1020,1230
process the keys and write

225
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,020
0,300
them.|

226
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,650
0,660 720,1050 1050,1530 1560,1800 1800,2100
So this is pretty much

227
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,410
0,510 510,1230 1230,1440 1440,1890 1890,2760
taken from the sequential implementation|

228
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,550
0,390 420,600 600,720 720,840 840,1110
and how you would apply

229
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,340
0,90 90,390 390,840 2040,2250 2250,2790
the map function.| And then

230
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,990
0,930 930,1470 2400,3270 3360,3510 3510,3840
similarly, we implement the reduce

231
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,780
0,600 870,1650 1710,2100 2100,2160 2160,2790
function,| so here's a performMap,

232
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,040
0,450 450,540 540,630 630,780 780,1140
and then we have {performReduce

233
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,050
0,600 960,1320 1320,1680 1680,1860 1860,2010
-}| and so what that

234
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,010
0,240 240,390 390,540 540,750 750,960
does is,| it gets all

235
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,380
0,60 60,570 570,1170 2040,2280 2280,2370
the intermediate files with the

236
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,570
0,660 960,1560 1620,1890 1890,2100 2100,2190
appropriate,| {} from all the

237
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,430
0,240 240,750 840,1350 1350,1560 1560,1860
map tasks, for this reduced

238
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,610
0,420 1080,1770 1800,2280 2280,2850 2940,3180
task| and sorts them, so

239
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,120
0,390 390,1080 1110,1470 1470,2100
sorting happens in the,

240
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,930
0,180 180,300 300,900 930,1560 1860,2190
in the worker,| because the

241
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,000
0,330 330,780 870,1080 1080,1650 1650,2070
worker needs, the reducer needs

242
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,470
0,510 510,810 810,1110 1110,1380 1380,1470
access to all keys of

243
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,330
0,150 150,600 630,780 780,1200 1260,1860
that type| and then {to,sort}

244
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,340
0,510
them.|

245
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,350
0,390 390,630 630,810 810,990 990,1110
It wouldn't make sense for

246
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,220
0,60 60,420 420,570 570,780 780,870
the mapper,| just sort them

247
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,170
0,660 690,1350 1350,1440 1440,1770 1770,1950
before,| because the mapper only

248
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,160
0,780 810,1170 1170,1260 1260,1770
has {access,to} the keys.|

249
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,130
0,150 150,240 240,390 390,630 630,690
And then we apply the

250
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,050
0,330 330,720 720,1230 1380,1590 1590,1920
reduce function to all values

251
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,280
0,90 90,150 150,360 360,810 810,1230
of the same key,| and

252
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,080
0,210 210,390 390,870 870,1140 1140,1800
then we {atomically -} rename

253
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,730
0,180 180,600 600,960 960,1410 1410,1590
the temporary reduce file to

254
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,760
0,330 360,720 720,1050 1050,1350
the final reduce file.|

255
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,810
0,330 330,810 810,1110 1110,1710 2010,2340
So, now this loop we've

256
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,940
0,750 750,1560
implemented basically,|

257
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,320
0,180 180,660 660,1140 1140,1230 1230,1320
the actual performance of the

258
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,380
0,870 900,1440 1860,2430 2430,2910 2910,3060
task| and we're basically done

259
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,280
0,150 150,240 240,510 510,1290
with the worker implementation.|

260
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,350
0,270 270,480 480,690 690,960 960,1530
So one last step remains|

261
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,390
0,360 360,510 510,720 720,1230 1230,1980
{} and that's actually implementing

262
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,970
0,690 720,1620 1650,2190 2190,2310 2310,2580
{how,this} coordinator tells the worker

263
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,830
0,330 330,720 720,840 840,1290 1650,1860
which tasks to do| and

264
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,950
0,150 150,390 390,1200 1200,1860 2940,3120
this is probably where you

265
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,080
0,150 150,330 330,450 450,1080 1440,2130
ran into the most complexity

266
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,940
0,210 210,960 960,1170 1170,1320 1320,1860
with synchronization in the coordinator.|

267
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,450
0,270 270,420 420,510 510,600 600,1410
{So,go} back to the coordinator,|

268
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,210
0,600 690,1110 1110,1290 1290,1590 1590,1710
so nothing has changed in

269
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,940
0,510 600,1380 1800,2100 2100,2400 2400,2730
the state,| so, but now

270
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,960
0,180 180,360 360,600 600,780 780,1020
what we've done is,| we've

271
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,890
0,300 300,390 390,750 750,840 840,930
added a loop in the

272
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,260
0,810 840,1140 1140,1890 1890,2310 2310,2370
coordinator,| that handles sending the

273
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,820
0,360 360,420 420,540 540,1050
task to the worker.|

274
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,760
0,630 720,1410 1440,1740 1740,2460
And {} when we're

275
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,770
0,570 570,660 660,900 900,1410 1410,2010
issuing the map task,| so

276
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,640
0,270 270,360 360,540 540,630 630,840
first we want to issue

277
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,080
0,90 90,150 150,360 360,780 1140,1440
all the map task| and

278
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,120
0,420 660,1200 1200,1500 1500,1740 1740,2040
so essentially what this loop

279
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,300
0,300 300,840 1320,1890 1920,2850 2910,3180
does here is| until there's

280
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,130
0,90 90,510 510,630 630,1350 1530,1830
a task to issue,| the

281
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,270
0,930 960,1590 1890,2760 3510,4020 4020,4140
coordinator will just iterate through

282
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,950
0,180 180,660 930,1380 1380,1560 1560,1680
this loop,| and if we're

283
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,640
0,180 180,300 300,390 390,480 480,690
done with all the map

284
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,570
0,270 270,360 360,510 510,750 750,930
tasks,| that will break out

285
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,400
0,90 90,420
the loop,|

286
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,780
0,330 330,570 570,780 780,960 960,1050
and then, if all the

287
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,860
0,420 420,510 510,780 780,960 960,1080
map tasks are done,| then we

288
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,680
0,330 330,660 660,1290
issue reduce task,|

289
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,310
0,330 330,480 480,720 720,870 870,1230
which is what's in here.|

290
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,620
0,600 1320,1860 2490,2700 2700,3180 3180,3240
So, yeah, I have, I

291
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,390
0,180 180,540 990,1230 1230,1500 1500,1770
guess I have one last

292
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,880
0,360 360,750 750,1170 1170,2100 2220,2490
step,| which is actually what

293
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,350
0,150 150,510 510,810 810,900 900,1470
we do, when the maps

294
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,810
0,210 210,1080 1290,1890 1980,2250 2250,2460
or reduces,| {} when there's

295
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,520
0,270 270,630 630,690 690,1260 1290,1710
no task to issue| and

296
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,360
0,150 150,270 270,450 450,570 570,840
so we want to do

297
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,100
0,600 690,930 930,1020 1020,1560 1560,1740
then,| is the coordinator should

298
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,020
0,330 360,840 870,1470 1500,1620 1620,1920
just wait for a task

299
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,480
0,660 930,1440 1440,1710 1710,2010
issue| and once it,

300
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,550
0,420 420,480 480,750 750,1350 1350,1980
there's a task issue,| another

301
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,020
0,480 480,600 600,720 720,1140 1170,1470
issue through the loop| and

302
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,940
0,180 180,630 630,1110 1290,1380 1380,1920
then actually issue the task.|

303
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,120
0,270 270,540 540,960 960,1260 1260,1470
{} I'll continue until all

304
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,290
0,90 90,390 390,600 600,780 780,1170
the map were all reduced

305
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,600
0,270 270,360 360,720
tests are done.|

306
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,070
0,330 330,570 570,840 840,1050 1050,1350
And after done, I'll return

307
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,380
0,480 510,1140 1710,1890 1890,1980 1980,2310
again,| so let me go.|

308
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,350
0,450 690,1350 1470,1680 1680,2100 2100,2730
Right, so in order to

309
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,120
0,720 720,1080 1080,1830
support that waiting,|

310
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,650
0,420 420,570 570,1380 1410,1860 1860,2010
what my solution does is

311
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,360
0,120 120,570 570,780 780,1170 1170,1710
it uses a condition variable,|

312
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,520
0,870 1560,2310
{} and

313
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,650
0,510 510,720 720,900 900,1320 1320,1860
essentially what that does is,|

314
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,780
0,450 450,630 630,750 750,1440 1530,1890
if there are no map

315
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,870
0,390 390,1110 1470,1890 1920,2370 2370,3090
task issue,| but the mappers,

316
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,530
0,570 1170,1590 1620,2010 2040,2790 2940,3630
{ -} but there, because

317
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,610
0,210 210,570 570,660 660,720 720,1080
we've assigned all of them,

318
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,960
0,150 150,750 780,930 930,1050 1050,1350
for example| and we're waiting

319
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,550
0,120 120,510 540,1020 1020,1290 1290,1590
for them| and they haven't

320
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,020
0,240 240,420 420,810 900,1290 1290,1470
timed out yet,| then we

321
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,610
0,180 180,240 240,510 510,1050 1050,1590
want to do is wait,|

322
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,340
0,750 810,1380 1380,1470 1470,2070 2220,2670
{} because we cannot issue

323
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,510
0,120 120,510 510,870 870,1020 1020,1170
a reduce task,| if all

324
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,740
0,90 90,420 420,540 540,720 720,1230
the mappers have not finished,|

325
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,510
0,810 930,1110 1110,1260 1260,1380 1380,1470
so we're just going to

326
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,580
0,240 240,780 900,1170 1170,1560 1560,2070
wait here| and then once

327
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,690
0,150 150,570 570,810 810,1020 1020,1110
we get some type of

328
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,190
0,720 780,990 990,1170 1170,1350 1350,1500
signal,| we're just going to

329
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,120
0,180 180,450 450,540 540,690 690,930
go back to the top

330
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,040
0,120 120,270 270,660
of this loop,|

331
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,060
0,240 240,480 480,690 690,780 780,930
and check whether we can

332
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,680
0,210 210,270 270,570 570,990
issue a task again.|

333
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,600
0,1140 1650,2220 2250,2520 2520,2580 2580,3090
Similarly, if all the reducers

334
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,800
0,270 270,570 570,690 690,780 780,1200
aren't done,| but we can't

335
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,450
0,360 360,690 690,1050 1080,1500 1530,1650
actually issue the worker a

336
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,520
0,540 570,900 900,1170 1170,1530 1530,2070
task,| we're going to wait

337
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,960
0,630 780,1020 1020,1110 1110,1230 1230,1380
for there to be some

338
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,980
0,180 180,270 270,720 720,840 840,1020
type of signals,| so when

339
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,810
0,150 150,240 240,630 630,1170 1170,1830
does the signal actually happen.|

340
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,520
0,690
Well,

341
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,590
0,210 210,480 480,750 750,1290 1290,1740
we want to signal any

342
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,350
0,660 810,1680 1830,2010 2010,2490 2490,2760
time either a task has

343
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,340
0,240 240,390 390,540 540,720 720,990
gone on for too long|

344
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,300
0,90 90,180 180,450 450,660 660,960
and we haven't heard back,|

345
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:23,960
0,120 120,270 270,420 420,540 540,660
so there might have been

346
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,070
0,120 120,750 1470,2160 2490,3060 3090,4110
a failure| or if the,

347
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,030
0,150 150,270 270,570 570,690 690,930
if a worker has actually

348
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,470
0,450 450,540 540,930 930,1320 1320,1440
completed a task,| because for

349
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,730
0,420 420,600 600,840 840,1140 1140,1260
example that might mean all

350
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,050
0,90 90,360 360,660 660,780 780,1320
the map tasks has finished,|

351
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,740
0,120 120,270 270,450 450,600 600,690
we can move on to

352
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,920
0,90 90,390 390,840
a reduce task.|

353
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,910
0,390 390,510 510,870 870,1500 3150,3480
So in order to do

354
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,610
0,300 300,480 480,660 660,1380 1710,2700
that,| what we have are,|

355
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,400
0,270 270,480

356
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,980
0,150 150,300 300,420 420,750 750,960
we have a Go routine

357
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,800
0,510 540,1290
here,| that's

358
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,380
0,630
{}

359
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,870
0,270 270,330 330,660 660,1080 1140,1800
kind of [spun] off immediately

360
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,940
0,150 150,240 240,840 840,1500 1620,2070
as the coordinator starts| and

361
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,440
0,180 180,360 360,720 720,1230 1230,1500
what this does is every

362
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,900
0,210 210,300 300,960 1260,1950 2010,2460
once in awhile,| {} after

363
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,760
0,510 600,720 720,1020 1260,1620 1620,1860
some you know maybe every

364
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,260
0,360 360,480 480,1020 1050,1380 1380,1500
second or so,| when a

365
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,220
0,480 480,720 720,930 930,1560
task might have finished,|

366
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,330
0,120 120,360 360,750 750,810 810,1020
or maybe this is ten

367
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,920
0,330 330,390 390,930 1050,1260 1260,1590
seconds, {I,can't,remeber},| {} actually

368
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,210
0,60 60,270 270,480 480,960 990,1290
it doesn't really matter,| it

369
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,140
0,210 210,420 420,540 540,810 810,930
just wants to wake up

370
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,370
0,60 60,570 570,810 810,960 960,1230
the coordinator every so often,|

371
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,840
0,210 210,330 330,1140 1170,1320 1320,1470
so the coordinator will do

372
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,400
0,450 450,870 1020,1140 1140,1290 1290,1560
another check| to see whether

373
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,360
0,330 360,510 510,570 570,900 900,960
there is a task to

374
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,890
0,600 750,1050 1050,1140 1140,1290 1290,1530
issue| and so it just

375
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,350
0,210 210,750 960,1440 1680,2070 2070,2460
loops around| and every second

376
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,940
0,180 180,900 930,1110 1110,1500 1500,1590
{it,will} broadcast to {wake,up} the

377
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,920
0,750
coordinator.|

378
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,630
0,630 930,1290 1290,1620 1620,1920 1920,2010
And the other time we

379
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,470
0,150 150,240 240,570 570,780 780,840
want to signal when a

380
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,140
0,270 270,450 450,1080 1500,2160 2160,2670
task is finished,| so that's

381
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,430
0,330 330,450 450,540 540,930 930,1080
actually going to happen in

382
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,110
0,180 180,510 510,750 750,1410 1440,1680
this handle finish task,| which

383
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,470
0,390 390,1080 1140,1620 1620,2760 2760,3360
is called when a worker

384
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,090
0,300 300,870 900,1110 1110,1440 1440,1500
like [] {} finished the

385
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,760
0,420 420,1050 1590,1920 1920,2310 2310,2670
task RPC| and so here

386
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,890
0,150 150,690 900,1200 1200,1890 1890,2130
we have a broadcast right

387
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,590
0,510 510,810 810,1260 1290,1860 2370,2700
after we set the []

388
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,560
0,360 360,900 1200,1530 1530,2070 2100,2550
to done or to complete

389
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,660
0,150 150,240 240,690 1170,1740
it to done| and

390
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,960
0,420 420,780 810,1440 1440,1680 1680,2070
when the coordinator goes back

391
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,010
0,180 180,600 600,840 840,960 960,1050
to go check one of

392
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,060
0,210 210,510 510,660 660,780 780,1050
these loops| and see whether

393
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,950
0,240 240,270 270,690 690,1050 1110,1890

394
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,570
0,210 210,330 330,570 570,810 810,1590

0,420 420,1140
done status.|

396

0,690 1110,1440 1440,2310 2310,2490 2490,3120
So that's essentially my solution,|

397
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,850
0,690 1050,1260 1260,1590 1590,1890 1890,2340
{} it gives cond vars

398
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,330
0,660 660,840 840,1440 1440,2040 2430,3480

0,150 150,330 330,480 480,720 720,960

0,480 1080,1560 1560,1890 1920,2430 2430,2670

every second,|

00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,160
0,300 300,750 750,870 870,1410 1470,2340
five seconds or something,| then

494
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,070
0,480 480,870 870,1320 1530,2280 2310,2670
yes, this is essentially very

495
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,990
0,420 420,540 540,1050 1080,1620 1680,1920
similar to sleeping for one

496
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,360
0,300 300,510 510,840
second every loop.|

497
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,050
0,420 1140,1770 1770,1860 1860,2250 2250,2370
I have a question,| I

498
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,010
0,210 210,300 300,540 540,630 630,960
think I missed the part

499
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,400
0,210 210,360 360,870
where you run,|

500
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,830
0,570 570,720 720,1290 1290,1740 1950,2250
how you handle, {} when

501
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,420
0,630 630,1110 1110,1410 1410,1530 1530,1590
a request comes for a

502
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,400
0,540 540,1350 1380,1590 1590,1770 1770,1980
task,| but you're like there's

503
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,450
0,90 90,600 600,690 690,840 840,1050
no tasks to give out

504
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,130
0,420 420,630 630,1200 1500,1620 1620,1680
currently,| like you, how do

505
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,390
0,60 60,240 240,330 330,630 630,1260
you tell the worker to

506
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,770
0,240 240,450 450,660 660,900 900,1110
like sort of either come

507
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,120
0,300 300,390 390,450 450,810 1140,1350
back| or do you keep

508
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,010
0,150 150,600 630,1080 1410,1650 1650,1890
them waiting| and sort of

509
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,440
0,600 600,690 690,1110 1140,1710
[tangentially] to that, {}|

510
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,300
0,210 210,570 570,840 840,1020 1020,1440
I'm curious why you chose

511
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,640
0,240 240,480 480,1290 1350,2280 2280,2340
this like sleep way of

512
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,930
0,270 270,390 390,720 720,810 810,1290
doing it| instead of just

513
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,660
0,210 210,570 570,660 660,1020 1020,1170
like checking the time when

514
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,720
0,150 150,570
you get

515
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,040
0,210 210,600 600,690 690,1200 1200,1320
{} request for tasks| and

516
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,140
0,480
seeing,

517
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,010
0,210 210,390 390,510 510,660 660,750
like when you get a

518
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,570
0,510 510,720 720,900 900,1260 1260,1560
request,| what has timed out

519
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,080
0,150 150,630 630,900
and reissuing it,|

520
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,990
0,480 480,870 870,1320 1470,2160 2190,2670
then instead of like constanly

521
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,100
0,510
checking.|

522
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,640
0,1320 1320,1350 1350,1890
Yeah, okay, so,|

523
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,500
0,480 480,810 810,1260 1260,1500 1500,1710
yeah, so I'll just your

524
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,740
0,570 570,960 960,1440 1830,2460 2640,3240
first question first,| {} so

525
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,680
0,1020 1500,1800 1800,1950 1950,2400 2400,2940
basically how I handle the

526
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,650
0,330 330,780 780,870 870,1410 2280,2910
I've completed the task,| is

527
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,600
0,780 960,1560 1560,1740 1740,2010 2010,2310
{} once all map tasks

528
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,010
0,150 150,660 660,900 900,1050 1050,1410
have finished,| once all reduce

529
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,740
0,360 390,840 840,1140 1140,1740 1800,2730
{} tasks have finished,| then

530
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,810
0,180 180,630 630,810 810,1290 1350,2010
the task that we return

531
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,250
0,120 120,240 240,870 1020,1350 1350,1440
to the worker,| because the

532
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,810
0,270 270,450 450,750 750,1080 1080,1560
worker has called us {}

533
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,050
0,690 690,1290 1320,1560 1560,2070 2640,3180
{task,for}, task is this extra

534
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,250
0,420 420,720 720,840 840,930 930,1200
task type that I called

535
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,120
0,420
done,|

536
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,960
0,720 900,1500 1500,1680 1680,1920 1920,2280
and then I also said

537
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,910
0,360 630,810 810,1410 1410,1620 1620,1800
that the coordinator is done

538
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,010
0,120 120,600 1320,1590 1590,1830 1830,2100
to true| and so in

539
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,000
0,120 120,720 720,840 840,930 930,990
the workers, I'll go to

540
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,490
0,90 90,390 1530,1680 1680,1770 1770,2490
the worker| and the worker

541
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,480
0,240 240,1200 1890,2820 2820,3390 3390,3930
we have this loop,| that

542
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,890
0,510 510,630 630,750 750,1050 1050,1140
basically as the worker is

543
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,410
0,480 480,960 990,1650 2040,2250 2250,2520
asking for tasks,| if it

544
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,750
0,780 780,1260 1260,1830 1830,2100 2100,2190
gets returned tasks is a

545
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,250
0,210 210,630 630,780 780,930 930,1500
done task, then it exits.|

546
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,270
0,600 780,1110 1110,1320 1320,1470 1470,1590
{} So that's how I

547
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,950
0,630 630,1110 1110,1230 1230,1350 1350,1680
handle conveying to the worker,|

548
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,050
0,270 360,720 720,990 990,1590 1620,2100
that it should exit.| I

549
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,280
0,210 210,270 270,390 390,780 780,1230
guess I was asking like,|

550
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,320
0,390 390,810 990,1680 1680,1800 1800,2010
sorry, if you know let's

551
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,000
0,540 540,690 690,1170 1170,1560 1560,1680
say you're still finishing up

552
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,560
0,120 120,240 240,480 480,1110
on your map tasks,|

553
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,150
0,390 390,540 540,780 780,1380 1380,1590
and you get requests for

554
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,650
0,60 60,630 1020,1170 1170,1290 1290,1500
a task| and you still

555
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,670
0,210 210,360 360,480 480,600 600,1020
can't give out your reduce

556
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,560
0,540 960,1350 1380,1530 1530,1680 1680,1890
tasks,| how do you tell

557
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,680
0,90 90,600
the worker?|

558
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,020
0,360 360,840
Oh, so,

559
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,850
0,180 180,450 450,600 600,1080 1080,1680
a lot of you are,

560
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,070
0,300 300,570 570,1140 1140,1680 1680,2070
{} an alternative design is

561
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,290
0,690 780,1410 1410,1590 1590,1740 1740,2220
to| basically if the worker,

562
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,280
0,150 150,360 360,510 510,900 900,990
if there's no task to

563
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,980
0,150 150,270 270,840 1290,1890 2280,2700
give the worker,| then the

564
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,810
0,690 690,1200 1200,1230 1230,1710 1710,1830
coordinator returns a reply to

565
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,700
0,120 120,420 420,1320 1560,1770 1770,1890
the worker immediately| and the

566
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,470
0,330 330,990 990,1140 1140,1380 1380,1770
worker sleeps in its loop,|

567
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,600
0,780 840,1050 1050,1290 1290,1530 1530,1830
but you can see here

568
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,010
0,390 390,540 540,840 840,1200 1200,1410
right,| the worker loop, there

569
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,220
0,120 120,300 300,810
is no sleep,|

570
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,960
0,180 180,270 270,630 630,840 840,1140
and the reason for this

571
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,510
0,300 300,960 1170,1620 1620,2250 2250,2550
is,| because this call will

572
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,150
0,660 690,1080 1080,1200 1200,1800 1800,2640
block until the coordinator replies,|

573
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,460
0,270 270,360 360,540 540,1290
and in my solution,|

574
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,200
0,480 480,660 660,720 720,810 810,1710
going back to the coordinator,|

575
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,850
0,330 330,780 780,990 990,1170 1170,1290
for example like if you

576
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,760
0,180 180,330 330,570 570,1050
look at [] done,|

577
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,340
0,270 270,540 540,1380 1380,1530 1530,2160
in this solution, the coordinator

578
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,660
0,780
handler

579
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,110
0,270 270,810 810,1650 2100,2550 2580,3330
will not return that reply

580
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,450
0,150 150,330 330,930 1140,2130 2160,2340
to that call,| unless it

581
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,430
0,450 450,570 570,1020 1020,1290 1290,1980
has a task to return,|

582
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,770
0,570 570,1020 1110,1380 1380,1800 1800,1950
so it's, we're waiting in

583
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,020
0,90 90,1140 1290,1800 1800,2040 2040,2250
the coordinator rather than in

584
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,200
0,120 120,690
the worker.|

585
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,430
0,420 420,690 690,810 810,1530 1530,1770
{} So the coordinator is

586
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,950
0,120 120,750 930,1440 1590,1890 1890,2520
the one| that is constantly

587
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,390
0,420 420,540 540,690 690,1140 1140,1440
checking to see whether there's

588
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,360
0,60 60,810 900,1200 1200,1890 2010,2970
a task and sleeping,| whereas

589
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,550
0,120 120,540 540,960 990,1470 1470,2190
the worker just simply blocks

590
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,220
0,360 360,570 570,1170
on this call,|

591
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,900
0,450 450,540 540,1170 1170,1560 1560,1680
until the coordinator returns to

592
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,660
0,180
it.|

593
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,820
0,330 510,840 840,1020 1020,1980 2010,2130
Is there any advantage to

594
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,700
0,360 360,720 720,1350 1350,1680 1680,2880
doing it in the coordinator?|

595
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,160
0,750

596
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,830
0,420 420,570 570,1020 1380,1680 1680,2280
So I think one advantage

597
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,260
0,300 300,840
is that,|

598
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,400
0,330 330,480 480,960 960,1320 1320,2460
all the workers aren't constantly

599
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,020
0,420 420,540 540,1200 1470,1650 1650,1890
sending {RPCs -},| you send

600
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,250
0,90 90,570 570,780 780,1050 1050,1230
an RPC,| it's one {RPC

601
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,820
0,570 570,840 840,1440 1560,2040 2670,3570
-} per task, right,| whereas

602
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,900
0,150 150,240 240,510 510,600 600,1080
if the worker is constantly

603
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,910
0,330 330,450 450,1140 1290,1680 1680,2010
looping and sleeping and constantly

604
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,810
0,270 270,420 420,540 540,600 600,900
reply,| you have a lot

605
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,360
0,150 150,510 510,1080
more network traffic.|

606
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,390
0,600 960,1470 1530,1980 2010,2310 2310,2730
Okay.| Yeah, I think that's,

607
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,880
0,390 390,870 870,1140 1140,1860 1860,2280
but definitely both solutions are

608
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,710
0,600 600,900 900,1050 1050,1320 1320,1800
feasible,| and they both work.|

609
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,580
0,750
Great.|

610
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,440
0,540 630,780 780,1320 1350,1590 1590,1860
{} I had {} one

611
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,820
0,210 210,690 690,930 930,1140 1140,1380
other question,| which is I

612
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,200
0,330 360,510 510,810 810,1020 1020,1380
I I see you use

613
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,100
0,510 720,1740 1770,2790 2850,3630 3660,3900
a defer for {the,locking} quite

614
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,560
0,90 90,540 1830,2190 2190,2310 2310,2460
a bit,| while I was

615
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,480
0,210 210,630 660,1320 1320,1500 1500,1920
doing my implementation,| I I

616
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,800
0,570 570,720 720,1080 1110,1230 1230,1320
realized,| I mean in a

617
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,240
0,1020 1020,1650 1650,1980
straightforward function,| it,

618
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,920
0,180 180,900 930,1260 1260,1410 1410,1680
it's clear,| when it gives

619
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,630
0,450 450,900 900,1020 1020,1140 1140,1710
up control of the lock,|

620
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,130
0,510 540,1140 1140,1260 1260,1770 1770,1920
when but for example if

621
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,280
0,600
you,

622
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,860
0,510
like

623
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,530
0,300 300,840 870,1110 1110,1860 1890,2670
have a Go routine created

624
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,780
0,420 420,810 810,930 930,1650
from within the function,|

625
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,480
0,1140 1140,1380 1380,1650 1650,2130 2130,2460
it's not very clear, when

626
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,140
0,90 90,300 300,450 450,1200
it gives up control.|

627
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,870
0,330 330,510 510,780 780,1410 1440,1770
So a Go routine runs

628
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,860
0,120 120,180 180,600 600,900 900,990
on a separate thread,| so

629
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,200
0,150 150,570 570,1440 1650,2160 2160,2340
the {Go,routine} never starts with

630
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,670
0,120 120,420 420,1020 1020,1350 1350,1470
the lock acquired,| even if

631
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,960
0,150 150,450 450,630 630,810 810,1290
you spin off the routine,

632
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,370
0,420 420,570 570,840 840,960 960,1410
while you hold the lock.|

633
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,340
0,150 150,450 480,930 1230,1920 2280,2700
{Okay - -}.| Yeah.| If

634
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,020
0,270 270,420 420,930 960,1500 1500,1680
we, if we issue like

635
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,160
0,240 240,570 570,720 720,810 810,1140
a Go, if we create

636
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,810
0,90 90,270 270,870 930,1290 1290,1650
a Go routine,| it'll just

637
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,460
0,270 270,420 420,510 510,1080 1230,1650
spin up a thread| and

638
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,080
0,240 240,330 330,870 870,1050 1050,1560
from the beginning, it won't

639
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,360
0,180 180,270 270,780 840,1260 1260,2280
have a lock, right?| Yeah,

640
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,120
0,330 330,720 720,960 960,1320
it's actually just like,|

641
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,080
0,150 150,240 240,480 480,630 630,930
you know you think about

642
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,310
0,300 300,540 540,720 720,1110 1110,1230
another thread just starting to

643
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,900
0,240 240,540 540,990 1020,1350 1350,1590
run that Go like Go

644
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,700
0,480 480,720 720,1260 2820,4050
func, that function.| Yeah.|

645
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,970
0,540 780,1080 1080,1740 1770,2730 3000,3270
Yeah.| {And,then} defer unlocks at

646
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,190
0,420 420,1260 1290,1590 1590,1860 1860,2220
any return, like any return

647
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,640
0,510 510,900
statement there.|

648
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,500
0,390 420,720 720,960 960,1230 1230,1770
Yep, yeah, it's pushed onto

649
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,320
0,840 990,1530 2010,2490 2490,2700 2700,2820
a,| like basically like the

650
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,840
0,450 450,570 570,840 840,1410 1650,2520
functions to run when the,|

651
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,730
0,210 210,300 300,690 690,840 840,1350
there's a stack of functions

652
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,140
0,240 240,840
that the

653
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,680
0,570 570,1140 1140,1530 1560,1950 1950,2160
returning from like handle get

654
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,470
0,390 390,570 570,930 1380,2100 2460,2790
task will run,| so, {}

655
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,490
0,390 390,630 630,810 810,960 960,1020
I also have this in

656
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,330
0,90 90,450 450,540 540,750 750,840
the slides,| so you'll be

657
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,080
0,120 120,180 180,450 450,540 540,750
able to refer to this

658
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,900
0,450 750,1230 1560,2010 2010,2220 2220,2820
later,| but defer just ensures

659
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,400
0,180 180,390 390,540 540,900 900,1500
that when this function exits,|

660
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,170
0,210 210,660 810,1020 1020,1320 1320,1410
you over you around a

661
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,520
0,510 540,750 750,990 990,1170 1170,1350
lock| and then I could

662
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:16,280
0,390 390,600 600,1020 1020,4860 4890,5760
also do something, like unlocking|

663
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,070
0,630 960,1200 1200,1320 1320,1560 1560,1830
and like I could just

664
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,100
0,90 90,360 360,1290 1320,2010 2040,3030
do something like {} before

665
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,510
0,180 180,540 540,1080 1200,1470 1470,1830
the last print or [],|

666
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,180
0,690 870,1320 1320,1590 1590,1830 1830,2070
so these are all pushed

667
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,500
0,210 210,270 270,930 960,1110 1110,1320
onto a stack,| and then

668
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,750
0,240 240,630 630,870 870,1350 1530,2250
they're popped off in FIFO

669
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,140
0,540 600,990 1380,1890
order, no {LIFO,order}.|

670
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,900
0,660 840,1950
{} {What,FIFO}?

671
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,530
0,390 390,660 660,1080 1080,1470 1770,2040
First in first out, no

672
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,800
0,660
they're

673
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,990
0,540 540,1560 1980,2880 3660,4440 4920,5190
run in {last,in,out}, yeah,| so

674
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,860
0,480 480,810 810,1320 1620,2250
{it's,a,stack} right,| so {}

675
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,440
0,420 420,600 600,900 900,1260 1260,2430
this will run before unlocking,|

676
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,970
0,300 300,630 660,1050 1050,1230 1230,1530
which will actually run before

677
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,950
0,390 630,1260 1290,1650 1650,1830 1830,1980
the lock,| so if you're

678
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,360
0,150 150,240 240,420 420,840 840,1410
ready to use multiple defers,|

679
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,440
0,120 120,450 450,540 540,600 600,1080
be careful in the order,

680
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,750
0,270 270,480 480,840 1050,1770 1770,2250
then use them,| but deferring

681
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,100
0,150 150,720 720,840 840,1140 1140,1350
the unlock at least is

682
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,140
0,90 90,390 390,840 870,1620
a very useful strategy,|

683
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,280
0,210 210,330 330,480 480,570 570,1020
that will come in handy.|

684
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,380
0,390 420,1050 1140,1470 2100,2280 2280,2340
OK, { -} so the

685
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,300
0,330 330,480 480,870 900,1560 1650,1920
last thing is,| {} if

686
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,550
0,420 420,780 780,1050 1050,1590 1590,2250
we call a function within

687
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,980
0,600
{}

688
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,970
0,600 600,1260 1290,1800 1800,2400 2430,2640
within our our function,| where

689
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,680
0,210 210,570 570,720 720,1230 1350,1710
we acquire the lock,| it

690
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,720
0,510 510,900 900,990 990,1500 1530,2040
doesn't return the lock, right,|

691
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,400
0,360 360,660 660,840 840,1110 1110,1230
{} when it goes to

692
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,110
0,90 90,330 330,960 1380,1530 1530,1710
the other function,| the other

693
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,820
0,330 330,720 720,840 840,1050 1050,1710
function returns to this function,|

694
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,160
0,180 180,330 330,660 660,1050 1170,1560
and then until we like

695
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,510
0,150 150,450 450,750 750,840 840,1350
the thread keeps a lock,

696
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,690
0,660 780,1200 1200,1500 1500,1920 1920,2730
like through like jumping around.|

697
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,380
0,420 420,660 660,1050 1050,1140 1140,1500
Yeah, so like a function,|

698
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,460
0,210 210,540 540,690 690,750 750,1080
that's just like a normal

699
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,260
0,360 360,660 660,930 930,1170 1170,1800
function call within one thread|

700
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,970
0,630 690,900 900,1350 1350,1500 1500,1620
will be called with the

701
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,540
0,150 150,540 630,1080
{lock,out -} yes.|

702
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,240
0,390 390,900
Cool, thanks.|

703
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,320
0,390
Yeah.|

704
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,740
0,420 420,630 630,810 810,1050 1050,1200
Alright, so you guys have

705
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,060
0,510 510,720 720,810 810,1200 1200,1320
already kind of discussed some

706
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,130
0,120 120,180 180,660 750,1410 1410,2070
of the alternate synchronization designs,|

707
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,870
0,330 360,810 810,900 900,990 990,1350
like waiting in the worker

708
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,520
0,300 300,450 450,540 540,1500 1500,1650
rather than the coordinator| and

709
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,270
0,150 150,390 390,570 570,690 690,750
we've talked about some of

710
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,050
0,90 90,360 360,480 480,720 720,780
the pros and cons of

711
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:58,900
0,360
that,

712
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,490
0,330 330,540 540,1140 1170,1500 1500,1590
{} using time,| actually I

713
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,180
0,120 120,210 210,510 510,630 630,690
think you covered all of

714
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,800
0,240 240,630 630,750 750,1140 1140,1620
these except for channels, maybe,|

715
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,520
0,600

716
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,380
0,510 510,1020 1230,1500 1500,1620 1620,1740
so there's one thing I

717
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,340
0,270 270,360 360,570 570,810 810,960
wanted to know,| because there

718
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,450
0,90 90,180 180,450 450,870 870,1110
are a couple questions about

719
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,850
0,360 570,930 930,1290 1290,1890 1980,2400
this,| so waiting for map

720
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,750
0,270 270,330 330,420 420,780 780,900
has to be done| or

721
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,420
0,270 270,570 570,1740 1950,2370 2400,2670
like any synchronization that we've

722
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,400
0,630 930,1170 1170,1410 1410,1470 1470,1980
shown is on a single

723
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,070
0,750 810,1260 1260,1620 1620,1890 1890,2670
server,| so cross server communication

724
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,720
0,480 480,600 600,1140 1140,1440 1440,1650
between the worker and the

725
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,100
0,750
coordinator,|

726
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,660
0,270 270,510 510,990 990,1200 1200,1410
{} they're only it's only

727
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,340
0,270 270,570 570,750 750,960 960,1680
done ever by {RPCs -},|

728
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,080
0,420 420,540 540,930 930,1170 1170,1560
so for example like locking

729
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,430
0,120 120,210 210,840 840,1050 1050,1350
in the coordinator has nothing

730
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,300
0,90 90,210 210,390 390,750 750,870
to do with locking on

731
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,550
0,90 90,630 810,1350 1410,1650 1650,2250
the worker| or on interactive

732
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,560
0,570 570,990 990,1110 1110,1410 1410,2010
implementation locking on different servers,|

733
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,750
0,390 420,1020 1020,1440 1440,1620 1620,1770
like don't interfere with each

734
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,600
0,420
other,|

735
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,740
0,120 120,300 300,420 420,510 510,630
I just want to be

736
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,050
0,240 240,750 1530,1950 1950,2130 2130,2310
clear {about,that}.| {} So one

737
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,580
0,450 450,1050 1050,1260 1260,1410 1410,1530
thing I thought would be

738
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,870
0,660 660,930 930,1050 1050,1200 1200,1290
interesting is| for you to

739
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,180
0,420 420,1050 1080,1410 1410,1800
see a kind of

740
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,390
0,360 360,810 810,1050 1050,1620 1620,1860
an example using channels,| because

741
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,620
0,90 90,180 180,390 390,750 750,1230
there are also some questions

742
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,780
0,270 270,900 930,1260 1260,1500 1500,2160
using channels, about using channels.|

743
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,200
0,840 1530,1800 1800,2010 2010,2340 2340,2520
So this is kind of,

744
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,700
0,960 1410,1980 2190,3060 3270,4110 4110,4500
{is,a} not complete implementation of

745
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,800
0,300 300,870 1080,1620 1620,1830 1830,2070
using channels,| {} but it's

746
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,160
0,180 180,930 930,1320 1320,1890
a potential way to,|

747
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,120
0,180 180,300 300,510 510,690 690,960
but you could think about

748
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,770
0,330 330,600 600,1050 1050,1380 1380,1650
having used channels in {mapreduce

749
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,820
0,540
-}.|

750
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,160
0,330 330,900 930,1140 1140,1350 1350,2250
And so in this example,|

751
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,960
0,360 360,840 840,900 900,1020 1020,1620
the input to the coordinator

752
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,440
0,480 480,1170 1170,1320 1320,1950
actually includes a channel,|

753
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,780
0,180 180,840 1050,1440 1440,2100 2100,2250
in which the coordinator is

754
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,840
0,540 540,990 1020,1440 1440,2130 2130,3060
told of what workers exist,|

755
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,480
0,630 630,840 840,1230 1260,1530 1530,2340
and this is to handle

756
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,820
0,1020 1260,2130 2130,2340 2340,2670 2670,2790
the possibility that workers are

757
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,920
0,660 690,1020 1020,1230 1230,1470 1470,2100
failing,| and then some client

758
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,960
0,600 630,1080 1080,1140 1140,1770 1770,2040
is telling the coordinator,| hey,

759
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,160
0,180 180,480 480,810 810,1080 1080,1200
this other worker joined our

760
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,870
0,690 720,1110 1110,1140 1140,1350 1350,1710
cluster,| here's a new worker

761
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,770
0,120 120,210 210,330 330,510 510,900
that you can give tasks

762
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,450
0,330 540,750 750,900 900,1290 1290,1680
to,| so it's slightly different

763
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,280
0,120 120,360 360,810 840,1260 1260,1830
than what we had in

764
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,400
0,180 180,660
the lab.|

765
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,980
0,630 1020,1530 1530,1650 1650,2460 2460,3030
{} So the coordinator has

766
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,320
0,210 210,840
two channels,|

767
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,380
0,810 960,1260 1260,1650 1650,2460 2610,2940
one in which it will

768
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,140
0,600 600,1290 1290,1500 1500,2100 2220,2760
send tasks to workers| or

769
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,790
0,600 600,870 870,1050 1050,1320 1320,1440
it won't send tasks to

770
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,170
0,360 360,480 480,780 780,1170 1170,1380
workers,| will send tasks to

771
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,030
0,540 570,1200 1200,1320 1320,1500 1500,1860
a thread, that will issue

772
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,220
0,330 330,420 420,1080 1830,2040 2040,2190
tasks to workers| and then

773
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,810
0,150 150,570 570,780 780,1050 1050,1590
it has a done channel.|

774
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,780
0,660 930,1860 1890,2580 2580,2880
So again, just like,|

775
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,370
0,270 270,450 450,660 660,1020 1020,1290
I I know I said

776
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,780
0,390 390,480 480,780 780,1200 1200,1410
something a little strange,| which

777
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,650
0,0 0,270 270,600 600,720 720,870
I was like you can

778
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,180
0,390 450,840 840,930 930,1320 1320,1530
send tasks to workers over

779
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,170
0,120 120,480 480,600 600,720 720,990
the channel, but you actually

780
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,360
0,480 600,840 840,1260 1260,1740 1740,2190
can't,| the channel is only

781
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,860
0,180 180,240 240,750 810,990 990,1500
on the coordinate your server,|

782
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,790
0,270 270,360 360,480 480,570 570,720
and we'll see how that

783
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,180
0,270 270,360 360,450 450,870
works in a second.|

784
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,250
0,210 210,330 330,840 840,1440 1440,1590
So the first thread of

785
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,780
0,90 90,630 630,750 750,870 870,1530
the coordinator that we create

786
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,700
0,270 270,420 420,630 630,1110 1110,1500
is a Go routine,| that

787
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,520
0,870 870,1380 1410,1710 1710,2010 2010,2790
basically will for every worker

788
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,030
0,810 810,1140 1140,1920 1950,2340 2340,2730
start the issue worker task

789
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,980
0,450
thread.|

790
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,280
0,690
So,

791
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,660
0,240 240,450 450,870 870,1200 1200,1380
what this does is,| as

792
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,820
0,570 570,1110 1230,1440 1440,1740 1770,2160
workers are you know coming

793
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,320
0,150 150,540 540,810 810,960 960,1500
and going,| because they're failing

794
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,390
0,120 120,300 300,1110 1290,1680 1680,2070
and then restarting,| this channel

795
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,920
0,420 420,810 810,1140 1140,1290 1290,1530
basically says,| okay, we want

796
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,120
0,390 420,690 690,900 900,1020 1020,1200
to for any of these

797
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,670
0,600 900,1620 1650,1800 1800,2400 2400,2550
workers,| start a thread that

798
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,260
0,150 150,450 450,630 630,960 960,1590
will issue this worker tasks.|

799
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,150
0,570 750,960 960,1110 1110,1590 1740,2190
{} So this is one

800
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,760
0,180 180,330 330,690 690,1050
Go {routine -} here,|

801
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,940
0,360 360,450 450,1020 1020,1170 1170,1320
then the coordinator what it

802
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,800
0,420 420,750 750,1080 1500,1740 1740,1860
does,| is it for all

803
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,760
0,90 90,390 390,510 510,600 600,960
the tasks that were giving,|

804
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,880
0,210 210,630
it just

805
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,020
0,180 180,360 360,690 690,900 900,1140
push those tasks onto this

806
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,260
0,210 210,660
tasks channel.|

807
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,570
0,540 630,1020 1020,1350 1350,1830 1830,1980
And this tasks channel, we

808
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,950
0,330 330,570 570,750 780,990 990,1380
actually made it a buffer

809
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,780
0,540 780,1230 1230,1350 1350,1470 1470,1830
channel,| so that we know

810
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,430
0,120 120,240 240,540 540,1350 1350,1650
it will hold exactly {numTask

811
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,320
0,480 480,840 840,1260 1290,1530 1530,1890
-} tasks,| which are the

812
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,570
0,360 360,720 750,1200 1200,1350 1350,1440
that's the limit of the

813
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,250
0,300 300,360 360,870 900,1260 1260,1680
number of tasks,| that will

814
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,690
0,390 390,480 480,540 540,870 870,1410
exist on the system,| so

815
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,190
0,210 210,360 360,660 660,1020 1020,1110
what this also means is

816
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,840
0,180 180,270 270,480 480,1140
that,| we can push

817
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,850
0,330 330,630 630,690 690,1290 1410,1980
the number of tasks {}

818
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,400
0,870 1110,1500 1500,1650 1650,2040 2040,2520
task onto this channel without

819
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,350
0,660 840,1110 1110,1200 1200,1800 1800,1950
blocking,| so the coordinator will

820
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,390
0,360 360,960 1020,1410 1410,1710 1710,2040
not block on pushing task

821
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,700
0,90 90,180 180,480 480,780
to the tasks channel.|

822
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,690
0,450 450,870 900,1020 1020,1860 1860,2520
And then the coordinator will

823
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,000
0,480 480,1080 1080,1320 1320,1590 1590,2280
read from this done channel|

824
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,700
0,900 930,1320 1350,1980 1980,2250 2250,2670
until it has done so

825
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,350
0,330 330,420 420,750 750,1320 1500,1650
number of task times,| in

826
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,240
0,510 810,1230 1230,1380 1380,1650 1650,1890
which case, it knows it's

827
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,710
0,420 420,750 750,900 900,1140 1140,1470
done,| in this case, where

828
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,540
0,540 540,780 780,1290 1290,1530 1530,1620
I'm not separating map or

829
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,800
0,330 330,540 540,690 690,870 870,1260
reduce tasks,| let's just imagine

830
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,270
0,180 180,390 390,720 750,1170 1170,1470
that there are,| some number

831
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,800
0,60 60,360 360,510 510,840 900,1530
of tasks that the coordinator

832
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,200
0,270 270,420 420,810
needs to run.|

833
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,800
0,630 630,900 900,1410 1590,1920 1920,2100
And once it knows that

834
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,730
0,270 270,450 450,540 540,810 810,930
tasks, all the tasks have

835
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,230
0,540 540,690 690,1080 1080,1170 1170,1500
finished,| it closes the tasks

836
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:51,280
0,510 1230,1410 1410,2010 2040,2520 2550,4050
channel, and then {} basically

837
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,980
0,390 390,870
will exit.|

838
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,640
0,270 270,750 780,1620 2280,2910 2910,3120
And so the, where some

839
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,110
0,180 180,600 600,1050 1050,1260 1260,1470
of the interesting part comes

840
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,480
0,180 180,630 870,1380 1380,1920 1920,2370
in is,| these worker task

841
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,800
0,360 360,540 540,720 720,1140 1140,1320
threads,| which I've separated out

842
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,160
0,120 120,480 510,1350 1350,1740
and just function here.|

843
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,220
0,180 180,480 480,780 780,1170 1170,1800
So, these all run on

844
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,880
0,510 510,1170
separate {Go,routines},|

845
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,010
0,210 210,420 420,540 540,1200 1470,2100
and what it does is

846
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,900
0,1170
for,|

847
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,100
0,210 210,600 600,780 780,1020 1020,1110
as long as there are

848
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,540
0,450 450,570 570,660 660,1020 1020,1440
tasks in the task queue,|

849
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,340
0,180 180,600 600,900 900,960 960,1350
it will pull a task

850
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,640
0,360 840,1050 1050,1530 1680,2220 3060,3300
out| and then oops, I

851
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,870
0,240 240,390 390,480 480,750 900,1230
didn't mean to that,| and

852
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,350
0,270 270,630 630,1470 1770,2880 2880,3480
then {} call basically an

853
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,490
0,750 750,930 930,1050 1050,1500 1500,1560
RPC,| that will send the

854
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,860
0,360 360,450 450,570 570,1110 1500,2370
task to the worker,| so

855
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,140
0,360 360,510 510,690 690,1470 1530,2190
note that this channel actually

856
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,150
0,450 630,1080 1080,1200 1200,1620 1620,2010
is talking to another thread

857
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,100
0,90 90,210 210,1080 1140,1650 1650,1950
of the coordinator| and that

858
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,480
0,480 480,690 690,990 990,1080 1080,1380
thread is actually the one

859
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,850
0,450 720,930 930,1350 1350,1530 1530,2370
that's in charge of calling

860
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,420
0,660 720,1140 1200,1830
{} the worker,|

861
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,700
0,540 540,1080 1140,1440 1440,1560 1560,1680
and then once it's done

862
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,990
0,120 120,180 180,630 630,840 840,1290
with a task, it says

863
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,180
0,180 180,630
it's done.|

864
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,330
0,210 210,420 420,780 780,1350 1350,1710
If it's not able to

865
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,710
0,390 390,510 510,780 780,1260 1260,1380
if the call fails, for

866
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,150
0,210 210,840 840,960 960,1350 1350,1440
some reason, for example it

867
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,520
0,300 300,720 840,1830
turns out,| then,

868
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,570
0,270 270,450 450,660 660,930 930,1050
what this loop does is,|

869
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,160
0,270 270,600 600,840 840,1260 1260,1590
it'll push that task back

870
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,260
0,300 300,390 390,750 750,1320 1530,2100
onto the task channel,| so

871
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,120
0,480 480,990 990,1200 1200,1590 1590,1860
another worker or potentially this

872
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,320
0,240 240,630 630,870 870,1050 1050,1200
thread again could pick up

873
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,460
0,180 180,690
that task.|

874
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,580
0,600 630,1080 1080,1410 1410,1860 1860,2220
So just to clarify how

875
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,440
0,180 180,570 570,1200 1200,1620 1620,1860
the channel communication works,| so

876
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,180
0,180 180,930 960,1350 1350,1650 1650,1740
the worker says tasks on

877
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,230
0,90 90,300 300,660 660,870 870,1050
the tasks channel,| which is

878
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,360
0,330 330,480 480,720 720,1320
read through these loops,|

879
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,110
0,810 840,1230 1230,1530 1530,1740 1740,2430
and this loop will exit

880
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,930
0,600 600,990 1230,2160 2160,2700 2700,2790
when the coordinator closes the

881
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:22,670
0,570 2160,3180 3840,4140 4140,4500 4500,4740
channel,| done, it's sent on

882
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,830
0,330 330,870 870,1170 1170,1500 1500,2160
these worker, issue worker threads|

883
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,290
0,630 660,930 930,1140 1140,1260 1260,1350
and it's read by the

884
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,540
0,840 840,960 960,1350 1350,1860 1860,2250
coordinator, the original coordinator thread|

885
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,510
0,720 960,1560 1560,1740 1740,1920 1920,2190
and this {exit -} equals

886
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,730
0,510 510,720 720,1230 1230,1950 2100,2220
true,| will basically tell the

887
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,170
0,810 810,1050 1050,1050 1050,1290 1290,1440
coordinator,| like, oh, I don't

888
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,070
0,150 150,240 240,600 600,780 780,900
need to listen for any

889
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,990
0,210 210,600 600,1170 1230,1530 1530,1920
more workers coming or workers

890
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:39,900
0,300 300,600
starting up.|

891
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,910
0,300 300,450 450,810 840,1350 1350,1890
So it will cause this

892
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,800
0,390 390,540 540,930 930,990 990,1620
other Go routine to exit,|

893
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:45,810
0,300 300,450 450,600 600,780 780,960
so I know that this

894
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,370
0,90 90,240 240,660 660,1140 1140,1560
is a pretty complex example,|

895
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,810
0,180 180,420 420,900 900,1290 1290,1440
it's also not quite what

896
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:51,570
0,570 1410,2250 2250,2310 2310,2430 2430,2760
we specified in the lab,|

897
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,560
0,150 150,270 270,360 360,900 900,990
but as an example of

898
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,000
0,240 240,600 600,780 780,930 930,1440
how channels can be used|

899
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,500
0,360 360,750 750,1020 1020,1230 1230,1440
to implement something like {mapreduce

900
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,060
0,600 780,930 930,1140 1140,1440 1440,1560
-} or something similar to

901
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,640
0,180 180,720
{mapreduce -}.|

902
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,640
0,210 210,390 390,480 480,780 780,1260
There is a question in

903
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,740
0,360 360,660 660,900 900,1320 1320,1590
the chat,| about where's exit

904
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,800
0,360 360,900 900,1080 1080,1530
define in this code?|

905
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,380
0,360 360,570 570,1020 1050,1290 1290,1740
That is a good question,|

906
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,770
0,330 330,750 1680,2160 2160,2910 2940,3390
it's not,| so it'll, it'll

907
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,910
0,120 120,660 660,750 750,990 990,1140
be exactly the same thing

908
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,650
0,180 180,660 1320,1440 1440,1530 1530,1740
is done,| it will just

909
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,280
0,150 150,1110
be another

910
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,380
0,600 600,900 900,1470
channel that's {}

911
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,920
0,180 180,510 510,660 660,1260
a {boolean -}, yeah,|

912
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,020
0,450 450,960 960,1230 1230,1590 1620,1860
that's a good, a good

913
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,140
0,600
cache.|

914
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,790
0,330 330,510 510,720 720,1230 1230,1770
Oh, can I.| I've seen.|

915
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,860
0,420 420,510 510,990 1320,1620 1620,1890
How do you add things

916
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,760
0,90 90,210 210,570 570,780 780,900
to the workers channel| or

917
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,450
0,210 210,330 330,420 420,630 630,690
when you add things to

918
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,470
0,60 60,360 360,660 660,840 840,1020
the workers channel,| like how

919
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,310
0,90 90,270 270,480 480,630 630,840
do you handle them {in,this}

920
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,260
0,420
case?|

921
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,180
0,450 450,780 780,990 990,1200 1200,1770
Yeah, so in this case,|

922
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,370
0,510 540,1110 1110,1230 1230,1560 1560,1950
{} worker the workers channel

923
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,320
0,450 450,1050 1050,1110 1110,1200 1200,1950
is provided to the coordinator,|

924
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,690
0,270 270,900 900,1320 1350,1590 1590,2280
so imagine that for example

925
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,760
0,660 900,1050 1050,1140 1140,1740 1770,2070
and you know how your

926
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,970
0,1020 1050,1260 1260,1950 2070,2760 2790,3210
coordinator was actually called| or

927
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,080
0,780 780,1440
created by

928
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,930
0,840 900,1830 1860,2760 3000,3300 3300,3810
the MR coordinator in main,

929
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,720
0,630 690,1320 1470,2190 2310,2610 2610,2760
in the {that,folder},| so we

930
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,330
0,300 300,900 900,1350 1740,2100 2100,2610
would imagine that in MR

931
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,160
0,900 900,1080 1080,1290 1290,1680 1680,1830
coordinator,| we would create a

932
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,100
0,780 810,1470
worker's channel,|

933
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,620
0,270 270,540 540,1200 1200,1380 1380,2160
and MR coordinator would basically

934
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,990
0,270 270,450 450,1230 1230,1470 1470,2280
be in charged of tracking,|

935
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,360
0,330 330,840 840,1680 1770,1980 1980,2220
when workers crash and when

936
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,580
0,480 480,1080 1110,1620 1620,1860 1860,2220
workers join,| so this is

937
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,170
0,240 240,810 810,900 900,990 990,1410
for example in a case,|

938
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,690
0,570 960,1140 1140,1320 1320,2010 2010,2520
where you know maybe new

939
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,800
0,540 540,630 630,900 900,1020 1020,1110
servers are added to our

940
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,390
0,450 450,630 630,750 750,1050 1050,1590
cluster at some later point|

941
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,070
0,510 510,720 720,1200 1200,1530 1530,1620
or some worker crashed and

942
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,780
0,240 240,570 570,990 1020,1590 1590,1710
then came back,| and MR

943
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,450
0,540 540,720 720,810 810,1710 1770,2670
coordinator would be constantly sending,|

944
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,030
0,600 600,960 960,1290 1290,1890 1920,2520
like these worker ids to

945
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,580
0,270 270,1170
[our] coordinator,|

946
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,070
0,210 210,510 510,660 660,930 930,1110
in order to tell it,

947
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,480
0,240 240,480 480,690 690,900 900,1410
hey, like there's new worker,|

948
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,740
0,150 150,480 480,750 750,1110 1110,1260
you should start issuing it

949
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,990
0,630 1350,1560 1560,1920 1920,2160 2160,2250
tasks,| so that part is

950
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,140
0,210 210,630
not shown.|

951
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,270
0,540 540,930 930,1230 1230,1740 1770,1920
God, yeah, I just I

952
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,580
0,300 300,780 810,1320 1320,1680 1710,2310
just {} wondering like,| so

953
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:43,840
0,180 180,510 510,840 840,900 900,990
that's really cool,| I was

954
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,690
0,150 150,510 510,1230 1410,2040 2490,2850
just wondering inside the lab

955
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,190
0,330 330,570 570,1140 1170,1380 1380,1500
1,| like how I think

956
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,480
0,150 150,510 660,930 930,1200 1200,1290
it's like [call] worker and

957
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,560
0,150 150,510 510,660 660,960 960,1080
you've defended {RPC -} to

958
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,700
0,90 90,660
the worker,|

959
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,350
0,720 720,930 1050,1200 1200,1410 1410,1650
{} if if that's something

960
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:53,830
0,90 90,180 180,270 270,390 390,480
we could have done in

961
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,120
0,240 240,660
lab 1?|

962
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,560
0,570 720,1320 1320,1800 1800,2220 2220,2460
It's possible it,| but it

963
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,910
0,420 420,660 690,1020 1020,1200 1200,1350
definitely was not what we

964
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,070
0,270 270,390 390,900 1110,1680 1680,2160
pushed you toward,| {} because

965
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,600
0,120 120,240 240,990 990,1320 1320,1530
you would basically, instead of

966
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,040
0,270 270,390 390,480 480,1170 1170,1410
setting up the coordinator as

967
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,510
0,300 300,540 540,840 840,1410 1410,1470
being {RPC -} server,| you

968
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,260
0,120 120,270 270,360 360,540 540,750
would have to set up

969
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,000
0,390 390,510 510,780 780,1230 1230,1620
like {RPC -} servers on

970
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,550
0,300 330,1050 1440,2160 2220,2430 2430,2550
the workers,| {} you can

971
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,930
0,300 300,570 570,960 990,1200 1200,1380
also think of, in this

972
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,600
0,1020 1200,1950 1950,2430 2490,3330
implementation call_worker could have

973
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,850
0,780 780,1200 1200,1410 1410,1620 1620,2250
handlers actually for each worker|

974
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,400
0,630 1110,1350 1350,1920 1920,2070 2070,2190
and each worker could be

975
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,710
0,540 540,630 630,1590 1620,2070 2070,2310
sending the coordinator like get

976
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,480
0,360 360,480 480,1080 1110,1590 1590,1770
task {RPCs -},| but a

977
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,120
0,1110
little,

978
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,350
0,240 240,270 270,570 570,1080 1110,1500
that's a little funky, {}|

979
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,490
0,210 210,330 330,510 510,990 990,1140
so in this example is

980
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,230
0,300 300,480 480,900 900,1020 1020,1740
actually more natural to imagine,|

981
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,810
0,300 300,1140 1260,1650 1650,1920 1920,2550
that call_worker, {} the coordinator

982
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,040
0,150 150,180 180,660 660,810 810,1230
is a client| and the

983
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,810
0,450 450,600 600,690 690,1050 1050,1410
workers are the ones that

984
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,940
0,210 210,720 720,990 1020,1200 1200,1830
are handling that {RPCs -}.|

985
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,820
0,750 750,1140 1140,1620 1620,1890 1890,2310
Yeah, okay, thanks, very cool.|

986
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,850
0,120 120,240 240,420 420,1050 1080,1620
I have two questions, {}|

987
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,650
0,420 420,840 870,1140 1140,1200 1200,1500
first is just a generally

988
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,940
0,360 360,690 690,870 870,990 990,1290
Go question,| so in that

989
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,260
0,390 390,630 630,900 900,1200 1200,1290
second for loop on the

990
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,760
0,480 540,870 870,990 990,1110 1110,1500
left, {} at the bottom,|

991
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,540
0,180 180,300 300,510 510,840 840,840
if you don't use i,

992
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,620
0,360 360,570 570,1230 1380,2010
will Go complain or

993
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,940
0,270 270,720
{in,a} {for,loop}.|

994
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,090
0,810 810,1530 1800,2130 2130,2400 2400,2610
{} So I run like

995
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,500
0,150 150,300 300,780 780,1290 1290,1410
all the Go linter and

996
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,960
0,90 90,330 330,900 1080,1560 1800,2460
all that stuff| and it's

997
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,700
0,600 780,1050 1050,1470 1500,1980
fine, I think,| like,

998
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,780
0,210 210,420 420,840 840,1440
in this case, you,

999
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,460
0,120 120,360 360,1050 1080,1260 1260,1590
do you need to have

1000
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,070
0,480 510,1140 1230,1710 1710,2370 2370,2610
i,| because you're incremented and

1001
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,390
0,480 480,570 570,930 930,1050 1050,1320
keeping the state of i

1002
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:19,420
0,690 720,1710 1980,2490
around through the.|

1003
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,350
0,360 360,450 450,570 570,660 660,930
Couldn't you do the same

1004
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,700
0,180 180,330 330,510 510,1050 1170,1350
thing,| with like a like

1005
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,190
0,1260 1260,1560 1560,1860 1860,2190 2190,2490
a while loop,| like just

1006
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,690
0,360 360,600 600,840 840,1260 1260,1500
for empty for loop with

1007
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:26,920
0,120 120,720
a select,|

1008
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,830
0,510 510,840 840,1020 1020,1770 1830,2400
{} where it's like popping

1009
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,080
0,210 210,330 330,810 1080,1710
off of done. {}|

1010
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,920
0,1110
So,

1011
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,210
0,690 870,1920 1920,2340 2340,2760 2790,2970
you can't actually,| well, you

1012
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,530
0,270 270,450 450,540 540,900 900,1320
still need to keep track

1013
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,360
0,180 180,570 570,1110 1110,1590 1590,1830
of how many times you've

1014
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,250
0,270 270,480 480,960 1140,1590 1590,1890
read from done, right,| because

1015
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,100
0,180 180,600 600,930 930,1620 1980,2850
you can't just read once,|

1016
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,630
0,150 150,330 330,480 480,1050 1080,1500
you have to read number

1017
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,160
0,90 90,540 540,1140
of task times.|

1018
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,830
0,420 420,960 1470,2130 2190,2430 2430,2760
{I,see,okay}.| Yeah, yeah, so you

1019
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,510
0,150 150,540 540,840 840,1140 1140,1680
do need some type of

1020
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,260
0,540 540,720 720,930 930,1290 1290,1620
state that will track that.|

1021
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,220
0,660

1022
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,300
0,150 150,420 420,1290 1290,1410 1410,1500
And then for for the

1023
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,470
0,270 270,390 390,510 510,870 870,1170
one on the right,| like

1024
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,120
0,300 300,660 690,1080 1080,1230 1260,1650
where you're reading from ask

1025
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,710
0,120 120,240 240,780 780,1020 1050,1590
and {re-populating -} it,| is

1026
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,840
0,270 270,420 420,1020 1200,1650 1650,1740
there like any downside to

1027
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,080
0,300 300,660
that, {}|

1028
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,610
0,240 240,360 360,540 540,720 720,1080
if you're like just constantly

1029
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,050
0,330 330,570 570,1020 1050,1350 1350,1440
reading and adding back and

1030
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,200
0,300 300,600 600,930 930,1560
forth {to,the} same channel.|

1031
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,660
0,630

1032
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,140
0,180 180,630
I don't,

1033
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,340
0,300 300,660 660,810 810,960 960,1200
I can't think of that

1034
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,090
0,90 90,270 270,360 360,570 570,750
the top my head,| so

1035
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,440
0,360 360,570 570,810 810,930 930,1350
in this case, at least

1036
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,540
0,330 330,570 570,1110 1440,1860 1860,2070
you won't block,| because every

1037
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,040
0,390 390,600 600,780 780,1050 1050,1500
time you read it,| you're

1038
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,990
0,570 570,960 960,1230 1230,1380 1380,1950
popping something off the channel,|

1039
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,940
0,300 300,480 480,960 1500,1770 1770,1920
every time you add it,

1040
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,970
0,180 180,480 480,1050 1230,2160 2430,3030
you're pushing something,| so because

1041
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,830
0,180 180,570 570,900 1020,1380 1380,1860
we have that the task

1042
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,450
0,180 180,390 390,720 720,1290 1320,1620
is a buffer channel,| but

1043
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,010
0,150 150,420 420,900 930,1200 1200,1560
you'll never block on that.|

1044
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,240
0,540
So,

1045
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,010
0,210 210,510 510,660 660,1140 1170,2490
in terms of like performance,|

1046
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,880
0,150 150,540
I think,

1047
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,710
0,150 150,360 360,900 1080,1410 1410,1770
I mean channels are built

1048
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,630
0,240 240,690 690,1200 1200,1650 1650,1920
using locks,| so locks are

1049
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,990
0,300 300,540 540,1260 1800,2700 3210,3360
usually more lightweight,| but I

1050
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,010
0,240 240,570 570,720 720,870 870,1020
don't think, I don't think,

1051
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,990
0,150 150,390 390,750 750,1410 1440,1980
you'll see a huge performance

1052
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,670
0,120 120,630 900,1350 1350,1560 1560,1680
in fact,| doing something like

1053
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,540
0,450
this.|

1054
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,980
0,600 630,780 780,990 990,1200 1200,1350
Okay, I guess, I've like

1055
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,570
0,420 660,990 990,1140 1140,1230 1230,1590
a,| sorry, just like a

1056
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,860
0,600 720,1140 1140,1290 1290,1680
general question of like,|

1057
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,060
0,240 240,390 390,540 540,1080 1080,1200
what's your like calculus for

1058
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,640
0,390 390,990
choosing between

1059
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,530
0,180 180,750 750,1140 1140,1650 1650,1740
{mutexes -} and channels or

1060
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,380
0,180 180,510 540,1050 1050,1050
like a hybrid {},|

1061
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,060
0,150 150,210 210,450 450,960
at the very beginning.|

1062
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,080
0,780 780,1440 1650,1890 1890,2340 2340,2520
Yeah, so {mutexes -} are

1063
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,850
0,300 300,870 870,1020 1020,1260 1260,1770
very natural for just protecting

1064
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,530
0,150 150,420 420,540 540,1290 1380,1680
a piece of state,| so

1065
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,230
0,420 750,1020 1020,2190 2220,2490 2490,2700
like your coordinator or like

1066
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,280
0,150 150,420 420,810 810,990 990,1050
your raft servers have a

1067
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,140
0,600 750,900 900,1140 1140,1350 1350,1860
log,| I want to protect

00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,820
0,420 420,510 510,870 870,1020 1020,1680

0,660 810,1710 1710,2130 2130,2940 3060,4170
{} that seems very difficult,|

1070
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,730
0,240 240,360 360,750 750,1020 1020,1620
or it seems very unnatural

1071
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,600
0,90 90,300 300,420 420,540 540,870
to try and do using

1072
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,120

1073
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,830
0,240 240,330 330,780 780,1320 1380,1710
using the channels lock,| you'd

1074
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,630
0,300 300,900 1020,1470 1470,1650 1650,1800
want to ensure that no

1075
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,770
0,180 180,360 360,480 480,1020 1020,1140
one else is modifying the

1076
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,360
0,420 420,630 630,840 840,1350 1350,1590

0,240 240,480 480,600 600,690 690,930
and then you would have

1078
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,690
0,450 540,1260 1260,1620 1620,1740 1740,2160
to essentially before you modify

1079
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,680
0,300 330,510 510,660 660,900 900,990
it,| try to read on

0,90 90,510 510,660 660,1020 1020,1200
the channel to ensure that

1081

0,450 750,960 960,1170 1170,1260 1260,1380
alright, like someone would have

1083
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,110
0,120 120,360 360,630 630,720 720,810
to send something on the

1084
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,220
0,360 360,570 570,720 720,900 900,1110
channel,| just show that they've

1085
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,350
0,420 480,840 840,1020 1020,1350 1350,2130
done,| they've been finished modifying

1086
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,360
0,270 270,510 510,690 690,1380 1410,2010
so and so forth.| So,

1087
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,450
0,120 120,360 360,570 570,660 660,930
in that case, it's actually

1088
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,650
0,270 270,480 480,570 570,990 990,1200
very hard to imagine how

1089
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,330
0,180 180,510 510,870 870,1260 1410,1680
you do channel,| where {mutexes

1090
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,920
0,390 390,570 570,750 750,1050 1080,1590
-} would make that completely

1091
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,520
0,780 2340,2610 2610,3030 3030,3270 3270,3600
straightforward,| where channels come in

1092
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,800
0,330 330,1050 1230,1830 1860,2160 2160,2280
very handy is,| like I

1093
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,440
0,360 390,1110 1260,2130 2130,2370 2370,2640
think our implementation already has

1094
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,450
0,120 120,630 630,1140 1410,1710 1710,2010
this apply channel,| is where

1095
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,400
0,210 210,570 570,750 750,1170 1170,1950
you have to wait for,|

1096
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,960
0,240 240,660 660,840 840,1050 1050,1320
{} in some ways, it's

1097
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:21,290
0,720 720,960 960,1500 1950,2850 2850,3300
almost like a specific instance

1098
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,060
0,150 150,240 240,690 690,1380 1440,1770
of a condition variable,| in

1099
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,020
0,240 240,360 360,570 570,690 690,960
which you want to wait

1100
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,850
0,120 120,780 780,960 960,1200 1200,1830
for something to be ready,|

1101
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,460
0,330 330,900 1140,1920
{} or a,

1102
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,140
0,750
{}

1103
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,000
0,330 360,870 900,1290 1290,1860 1860,2100
like a very specific type

1104
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,980
0,390 510,1080 1080,1170 1170,1410 1410,1980
of command to be finished,|

1105
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,980
0,810 1050,1860 2130,2520 2520,2790 2790,2970
{} so for something like

1106
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,570
0,420 420,840 840,960 960,1320 1320,1590
issuing tasks is actually not

1107
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,240
0,120 120,360 360,1020 2160,2310 2310,2670
a bad example| or something

1108
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,260
0,420
like,

1109
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,630
0,660 660,1530 1740,1920 1920,2100 2100,2370
blocking until you have something

1110
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,310
0,150 150,210 210,1020 1080,1320 1320,1680
on a queue,| like is

1111
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,120
0,150 150,240 240,450 450,600 600,750
you can almost think of

1112
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,110
0,180 180,330 330,480 480,600 600,990
it as like a queuing

1113
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,820
0,540 990,1260 1260,1380 1380,1530 1530,1710
system,| or at least that's

1114
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,810
0,90 90,450 480,720 720,840 840,990
how I like to think

1115
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,260
0,210 210,420 420,930
about it,| but,

1116
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,390
0,330 330,810 810,1320 1320,2040 2040,2130
for almost all modifications to

1117
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,620
0,330 330,750 750,930 930,1020 1020,1230
shared state,| like the race

1118
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,060
0,450 450,900
conditions {},

1119
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,580
0,360 360,1110 1140,1770 1770,2430
{} encounter locks are

1120
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,180
0,390 390,870 870,1020 1020,1110 1110,1260
much simpler| and in some

1121
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,200
0,330 330,420 420,630 630,900 900,1020
ways, a lot easier to

1122
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,500
0,300 300,720
reason about,|

1123
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,000
0,450
but,

1124
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,200
0,750 780,1200 1200,1410
yeah.| Thank you.|

1125
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,660
0,390 390,510 510,720 720,960 960,1080
Sorry, I {have,a} follow up

1126
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,270
0,390 390,900 930,1110 1110,1680 1710,2610
question to this slide, {}|

1127
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,550
0,210 210,690 690,1170 1470,2010 2010,2190
what happens if the,| so

1128
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,110
0,120 120,450 450,600 600,810 810,1560
you call the Go {issueWorkerTaskThread

1129
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,880
0,390 390,780 780,1020 1020,1260 1260,1590
- - -} which spins

1130
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,100
0,150 150,870 900,1140 1140,2040 2070,2220
up another Go routine,| I

1131
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,420
0,180 180,510 510,900 900,1200 1200,1320
mean, it goes through all

1132
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,500
0,90 90,510 510,630 630,720 720,1080
the tasks in the channel,|

1133
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,620
0,240 240,360 360,630
what is it

1134
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,690
0,900 900,1140 1140,1590 1620,1770 1770,1980
fails,| when it's what if

1135
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,040
0,180 180,360 360,720 720,1170 1170,1350
the Go routine fails,| when

1136
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,660
0,420 510,1020 1020,1260 1260,1410 1410,1620
it's sitting on the if

1137
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,100
0,330 330,930
{call_worker -}.|

1138
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,500
0,900 1020,1620
So, {}

1139
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,520
0,210 210,570 570,1530
if it fails,|

1140
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,440
0,240 240,450 450,1020 1050,1500 1500,1920
then I guess you've taken

1141
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,120
0,150 150,600 600,1110
a task out

1142
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,700
0,240 240,570 570,930 1020,1770
and not put back.|

1143
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,440
0,660 1050,1650 1650,1890 1890,2250 2280,2580
I'm actually not sure,| that

1144
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,060
0,240 240,450 450,1080
seems like {},|

1145
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,270
0,300 300,420 420,870 900,1080 1080,1290
like you're not, you're saying

1146
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,310
0,210 210,330 330,840 840,1230 1230,2040
like the entire thread crashes,

1147
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,620
0,390 390,720 720,960 960,1800 1830,2490
rather than as call_worker,| not

1148
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,420
0,330 330,720 720,1050 1050,1140 1140,1710
like returning falls or something.|

1149
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,640
0,330 330,510 510,1440 1440,1620 1620,1950
Yeah, like the Go routine

1150
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,860
0,750
crashes|

1151
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,570
0,240 240,330 330,690 690,1290 1290,1560
or is that possible for

1152
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,280
0,120 120,720 720,930 930,1500 1500,1710
a single Go routine to

1153
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,870
0,480 480,810 810,1170 1260,1500 1500,1590
fail| or would like the

1154
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,070
0,300 300,480 480,690 690,900 900,1200
entire thing just blow up.|

1155
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,800
0,300 300,720 720,960 1260,1500 1500,1620
Hey, {Frans,you,know}?| {} I think

1156
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,670
0,60 60,390 390,510 510,630 630,870
the model you should have

1157
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,440
0,90 90,270 270,1170 1200,1590 1590,1770
is that,| if a Go

1158
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,090
0,270 270,690 690,780 780,1140 1140,1650
routine crashes, the process crashes.|

1159
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,780
0,570 570,630 630,840 840,1350
Yeah, that {would,solve} it.|

1160
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,830
0,450 450,780 780,1230 1260,1800 1830,2250
{} Sorry, so if just

1161
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:31,700
0,660 690,1260 1260,2100 2610,3300 3330,3870
the worker crashes,| then you

1162
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,260
0,690
pick

1163
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,300
0,120 120,480 480,990 990,1470
a different task,| but,

1164
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,430
0,360 360,900 1170,1590 1590,1950 1980,2130
should you, I guess you

1165
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,990
0,90 90,300 300,600 600,750 750,1560
would still have the same

1166
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,520
0,930 960,1350
worker like

1167
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,420
0,330 330,1020
worker number,|

1168
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,600
0,630

1169
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,580
0,720 720,1290 1290,1740 1740,1830 1830,1920
{so,you} still connect to the

1170
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,930
0,270 270,780 780,1020 1020,1200 1200,1350
same worker, even though they

1171
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,540
0,480 480,1350 1980,2280 2280,2520 2520,2610
have failed.| Yeah, so in

1172
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,730
0,180 180,540 540,1440 1500,1830 1830,2190
this case,| basically {call_worker -}

1173
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,620
0,150 150,300 300,870 900,1320 1320,1890
would just continue returning false|

1174
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,470
0,600 600,690 690,870 870,1410 1530,2370
and you know this {Go,routine}

1175
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,540
0,510 510,900 900,1680 1680,1890 1890,2070
that's a specific for this

1176
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,800
0,300 300,450 450,570 570,810 810,1260
{worker -},| we just continue

1177
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,100
0,120 120,660 690,1440
to loop, {}|

1178
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,540
0,360 390,1110 1110,1860 1890,2760 2790,3120
and eventually when the map,

1179
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,640
0,240 240,330 330,930 930,1440 1590,2100
when the coordinator has determined

1180
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,360
0,90 90,210 210,300 300,570 570,720
that all the tasks have

1181
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,220
0,630 630,960 960,1050 1050,1620 1650,1860
finished,| {it'll,close} the channel and

1182
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,510
0,150 150,570 570,750 750,900 900,1290
then {like,Go,routine -} will exit.|

1183
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,560
0,600 600,1230 1440,1710 1710,2160 2160,2340
So there could potentially like,|

1184
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,780
0,150 150,480 480,660 660,1500 1800,2220
if all your workers continue

1185
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,160
0,510 510,630 630,750 750,900 900,1380
crashing,| you have like hundreds

1186
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,930
0,120 120,300 300,750 750,1290 1440,1770
of new workers joining,| like

1187
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:21,890
0,120 120,270 270,690 690,900 900,960
you could potentially have a

1188
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,390
0,300 300,480 480,690 690,1110 1110,1500
lot of Go routines just

1189
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,410
0,270 270,450 450,690 690,780 780,1020
there,| just like I can't

1190
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,310
0,390 390,480 480,720 720,810 810,900
contact my work| or I

1191
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,350
0,210 210,570 570,660 660,1230 1530,2040
can't contact my worker,| but

1192
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,850
0,330 330,420 420,720 720,900 900,1470
once the task is finished,|

1193
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,260
0,450 510,1050 1050,1110 1110,1260 1260,1410
this all of them will

1194
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,200
0,480
exit

1195
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,500
0,750
properly.|

1196
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,480
0,480 510,960 990,1530 1530,1920 1920,2040
Cool, alright, so that's an

1197
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,030
0,480 480,840 840,1500 1800,2310 2310,2550
example with channels| and now

1198
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,230
0,210 210,390 390,630 630,900 900,1200
let's move on to some

1199
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,600
0,210 210,780
of the

1200
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,850
0,330 330,780 1050,1380 1380,2100 2100,2250
more like your questions and

1201
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,810
0,360 360,480 480,660 660,810 810,960
bugs and things like that,|

1202
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,340
0,120 120,390 390,840 840,1170 1170,1530
so some common but passing

1203
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,690
0,300 300,690 690,780 780,900 900,1350
design mistakes that we saw|

1204
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,760
0,540 570,1140 1140,1380 1380,1620 1620,1860
was pushing too much work

1205
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,620
0,90 90,180 180,870 1140,1470 1470,1860
to the coordinator,| so essentially

1206
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,260
0,270 270,360 360,1140 1140,1830 1920,2640
making the coordinator bottleneck| and

1207
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,540
0,330 330,1020 1020,1500 1500,1590 1590,2280
this included both the coordinator

1208
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,750
0,360 1050,1770 1770,1830 1830,2610 2700,3210
and sorting the results| or

1209
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,790
0,60 60,720 720,1050 1050,1380 1380,2040
the coordinator reading file contents|

1210
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,620
0,540 540,780 780,1020 1020,1230 1230,1800
whereas a lot of the

1211
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,340
0,480 510,750 750,810 810,1140 1140,1200
{} kind of beauty of

1212
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,560
0,240 240,720 720,900 900,1290 1830,2220
{mapreduce -} is that,| all

1213
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,110
0,150 150,720 720,900 900,1410 1440,2550
the state all the computation

1214
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,240
0,570 570,840 840,960 960,1680
happens on the workers.|

1215
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,630
0,540 540,720 720,1260 1260,1920 2310,2970
{} And another con, {}

1216
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,250
0,390 390,600 600,810 810,930 930,1410
it's not really a mistake,|

1217
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,720
0,360 360,750 750,1110 1110,1290 1290,1470
but potentially something to think

1218
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,950
0,300 300,510 540,960 960,1140 1140,1230
about is,| how many {RPCs

1219
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,720
0,390 390,480 480,570 570,1080 1080,1770
-} are you sending| and

1220
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:27,840
0,420
like,

1221
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,210
0,270 270,510 510,810 810,1050 1050,1140
do you really need to

1222
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,530
0,210 210,390 390,600 600,1140 1140,1320
send that many {RPCs -},|

1223
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,330
0,360 360,480 480,1200 1200,1440 1440,1530
so for example sending an

1224
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,890
0,480 480,600 600,990 990,1350 1350,1560
RPC to check whether there's

1225
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,510
0,60 60,360 360,660 660,1380 1440,1620
a map task available| and

1226
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,830
0,150 150,390 390,810 810,1200 1200,1320
then sending another RPC to

1227
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,910
0,420 420,720 720,870 870,1020 1020,1080
ask like give me a

1228
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,820
0,750 780,1470
task,| is

1229
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,320
0,150 150,450 450,990 990,1380 1380,1500
{} little redundant| and you

1230
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,820
0,180 180,270 270,570 570,840 870,1500
want to try and reduce

1231
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,190
0,420 450,1260 1260,1680 1680,2010 2010,2340
the number and types of,|

1232
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,930
0,360 360,660 660,780 780,1290 1290,1650
like reduce the API between

1233
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,730
0,180 300,900 930,1170 1170,1290 1290,1800
the master or the coordinator

1234
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:49,980
0,120 120,210 210,750
and the worker,|

1235
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,260
0,390 420,600 600,780 780,1170 1470,1800
{} but these were, like

1236
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,280
0,120 120,270 270,510 510,570 570,1020
they were passed the test|

1237
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,720
0,480 660,900 900,1140 1140,1350 1350,1440
and it's just things we

1238
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,220
0,240 240,330 330,630 630,930
wanted to point out.|

1239
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:00,160
0,750 780,1860 1890,2160 2160,2370 2370,2550
So now okay cool, what

1240
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,060
0,210 210,420 420,630 630,720 720,900
about like how I do

1241
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,000
0,570 630,1380
lecture so.

1242
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,470
0,240 240,360 360,750 750,1020 1020,1410
For the next say like

1243
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,780
0,540 540,810 810,1380 1710,2190 2190,2310
five six minutes, what we're

1244
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,950
0,180 180,270 270,420 420,780 780,1170
going to do breakout rooms,

1245
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,900
0,750 840,1260 1260,1380 1380,1710 1710,1950
let let me stop sharing

1246
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,970
0,510 1140,1440 1440,1620 1620,1770 1770,2070
actually right, so do breakout

1247
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,140
0,390 810,1650
rooms and.

1248
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,490
0,630 630,1200 2850,3150 3150,3600 3630,4290
Oh shoot, let's see, um.

1249
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,950
0,210 210,480 480,720 720,930 930,1260
I think Sam just crashed

1250
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:23,960
0,120 120,450
on me.

1251
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:28,980
0,210 210,300 300,510 510,750 750,930
You can still have you

1252
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,380
0,210 210,600 1050,1920 1950,2160 2160,2400
see you alright I'm back,

1253
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,500
0,1770 1830,2310 2310,2790 2790,2880 2880,3120
yeah I upgraded to right

1254
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,400
0,180 180,360 360,660 660,750 750,900
before this lecture that was

1255
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,080
0,60 60,270 270,690 870,1320 1320,1680
a bad idea but alright

1256
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,710
0,90 90,150 150,420 420,570 570,630
for the next five or

1257
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,420
0,210 210,600 660,1110 1110,1260 1260,1710
six minutes, um, you should

1258
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,610
0,390 390,870 870,1020 1020,1380 1710,1860
talk about just like you

1259
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,470
0,210 210,810 810,1230 1230,1710 1710,1860
know any interesting bugs or

1260
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,240
0,630 630,750 750,900 900,1200 1200,1770
observations, you had about love,

1261
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,740
0,180 180,270 270,570 600,750 750,1110
are you good, you know

1262
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,910
0,540 540,720 720,840 840,1050 1050,1140
complain about how long it

1263
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:48,630
0,180 180,330 330,420 420,660 660,720
took you to find a

1264
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,700
0,270 270,720 1080,1440 1440,1650 1650,2070
certain bug or ask questions

1265
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,260
0,120 120,240 240,720 1050,1290 1290,1560
to each other and then

1266
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,640
0,150 150,330 330,810 810,1200 1230,1380
we'll come back and go

1267
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,750
0,180 180,330 330,390 390,510 510,1110
over some of your questions.

1268
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,220
0,570
Eight.

1269
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,280
0,840
HMM.

1270
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,420
0,720
Kay.

1271
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,080
0,450 480,840 840,900 900,960 960,1020
Alright, see you in a

1272
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,940
0,300
bit.

1273
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,780
0,150
Yes.

1274
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,270
0,210 210,360 360,510 510,720 720,930
Oh, so I find here

1275
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,320
0,210 210,750 750,840 840,900 900,1050
with frans do you want

1276
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,430
0,90 90,150 150,420 420,720 720,1110
me to review somewhere else,

1277
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,200
0,660 660,930 930,1380 1380,1500 1500,1590
probably best, but let me

1278
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:32,680
0,150 150,240 240,300 300,390 390,480
see if I can do

1279
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,760
0,60 60,540
it myself.

1280
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,120
0,780
Okay.

1281
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:35,960
0,270 270,420 420,510 510,630 630,780
I'm going to be right

1282
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,980
0,420
back.

1283
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,600
0,720
Interesting.

1284
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:41,330
0,570 1020,1620 1620,2040 2040,3060 3060,3540
Alright, are we mostly back,

1285
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,580
0,450
thanks.

1286
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,220
0,690
Ankle.

1287
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,940
0,360 360,750 870,960 960,1140 1140,1260
Great, so I hope that

1288
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,320
0,300 570,840 840,1170 1170,1290 1290,1380
was pretty fun or at

1289
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,310
0,270 300,540 540,720 720,780 780,990
least you got to talk

1290
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,750
0,210 210,330 330,420 420,780 810,1440
about some of your frustrations

1291
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:54,900
0,240 240,630 1860,2550 2580,2940 2940,3150
during below, um, yeah, so

1292
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,440
0,90 90,180 180,420 420,480 480,540
for the rest of the

1293
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,580
0,510 510,630 630,840 840,930 930,1140
lecture, we're going to go

1294
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,670
0,570 1410,1830 1830,2190 2190,2760 2760,3090
through first before questions take

1295
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,080
0,210 210,570 570,900 900,1080 1080,1350
some general tips that you'll

1296
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:01,950
0,210 210,270 270,480 480,630 630,870
want to look out for

1297
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:04,530
0,240 270,630 630,1080 1560,2130 2250,2580
for future lapse, um, so

1298
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:06,990
0,240 240,330 330,870 900,1770 2040,2460
first of all the one

1299
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,030
0,300 300,540 540,900 900,1200 1200,2040
thing you'll find very handy

1300
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,590
0,180 180,540 540,690 690,1110 1170,1290
for debugging is just you

1301
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,570
0,240 240,660 660,840 840,1260 1350,1980
know classic print f's and

1302
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:13,830
0,300 300,480 480,570 570,720 720,1260
so you can have conditional

1303
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:16,050
0,420 420,630 630,1020 1020,1530 1680,2220
protests which only print when

1304
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,400
0,180 180,510 510,630 630,1020 1020,1350
you want to debug, so

1305
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,270
0,150 150,540 540,600 600,750 750,870
for example you don't have

1306
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:19,080
0,120 120,270 270,390 390,480 480,810
to go through your code

1307
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,520
0,120 120,510 870,1050 1050,1230 1230,1440
and comment them all out

1308
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,570
0,270 270,360 360,780 780,840 840,1050
before you submit or something

1309
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:23,460
0,150 150,390 810,1140 1140,1560 1560,1890
like that, and so in

1310
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,710
0,90 90,510 510,1080 1290,1590 1590,2250
the rath lab we provide

1311
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,450
0,330 330,570 570,1110 1110,1620 1620,1740
this deep princess and the

1312
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:28,960
0,600 600,1230
Youtube profile.

1313
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:30,670
0,360 360,570 570,690 690,840 840,1380
Um, and you can modify

1314
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,800
0,450 810,1080 1080,1230 1230,1650 1650,2130
that to for example also

1315
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,170
0,450 450,780 930,1320 1320,1680 1680,2370
printout like the server ID

1316
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,370
0,360 360,600 600,840 840,930 930,1200
every single time you called

1317
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,390
0,120 120,330 330,600 600,690 690,1020
you print f or something

1318
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:39,460
0,180 180,630 750,1500
like that so.

1319
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,200
0,150 150,270 270,900 900,1260 1260,1620
Yeah I customize it to

1320
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,400
0,150 150,360 360,600 600,900 900,1170
you know print out different

1321
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,170
0,390 390,510 510,900 900,1410 1410,1770
colors for different bc things

1322
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:45,300
0,180 180,450
like that.

1323
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,610
0,660 720,1050 1050,1500 1500,1770 1770,2220
Um, and also like redirecting

1324
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,140
0,120 120,420 420,1140 1200,1410 1410,1530
your output files, just so

1325
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,010
0,180 180,270 270,420 420,690 690,870
you can like search the

1326
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,630
0,540 540,780 780,960 960,1080 1080,1620
files will come in happy

1327
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,220
0,1080
another.

1328
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,420
0,240 240,390 390,690 690,990 990,1200
Trick that you probably want

1329
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,650
0,420 450,630 630,720 720,1020 1020,1230
to keep in mind is

1330
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:57,720
0,150 150,480
you can.

1331
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,800
0,300 300,480 480,690 690,810 810,1080
Look at all the governor

1332
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,060
0,330 330,420 420,690 690,1140 1140,1260
teens to see where and

1333
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,840
0,450 930,1620 1620,2250 2550,3120 3360,3780
their execution, they're running and

1334
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,270
0,150 150,420 420,600 600,1470 1500,2430
so just type control backlash

1335
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:07,200
0,180 180,360 360,480 480,600 600,930
in order to do that.

1336
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,910
0,690 690,840 840,1110 1110,1320 1320,1650
And the final thing which

1337
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,080
0,330 330,540 540,600 600,870 870,1170
forty sort of talked about,

1338
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,880
0,150 150,390 390,960 960,1500 1530,1800
are these surfers and these

1339
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,110
0,240 240,360 360,480 480,900 900,1230
slides will be uploaded also,

1340
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:14,950
0,150 150,270 270,360 360,630 630,840
so you can refer back

1341
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:17,230
0,90 90,420 750,1500 1530,1770 1770,2280
to them, um, but essentially

1342
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,340
0,120 120,570
you can.

1343
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,830
0,420 420,1530 1560,2100 2100,2220 2220,2490
Push multiple functions to run

1344
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:23,350
0,240 240,630 630,1320 1410,1860 1860,2520
right before the function returns

1345
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,750
0,540 600,1290 1320,1560 1560,1710 1710,2100
and they just be careful

1346
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,060
0,90 90,210 210,780
of the ordering.

1347
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,900
0,600 630,930 930,1440 1440,1740 1740,1980
Alright, so now let's get

1348
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,220
0,180 180,360 360,420 420,630 630,1320
to some of your questions.

1349
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,530
0,300 300,480 480,630 630,690 690,810
Um a lot of you

1350
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,360
0,390 390,690 690,1110 1110,1380 1380,1830
submitted also questions about raft

1351
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,010
0,330 330,750 750,960 960,1230 1230,1650
so those will get two

1352
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,170
0,450 720,900 900,1260 1260,1620 1620,2160
for the rescue ne or

1353
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,720
0,300 300,660 660,1200 1200,1950 1950,2160
maybe office hours or yeah

1354
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,620
0,90 90,300 360,690 690,810 810,900
it's a fun way to

1355
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,120
0,390 390,990 990,1170 1170,1260 1260,1500
focus mostly on the ones

1356
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,710
0,150 150,390 390,900 930,1230 1230,1590
from map reduce or maybe

1357
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:46,490
0,120 120,330 330,600 600,660 660,780
have time then we can

1358
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:48,380
0,270 270,480 480,840 840,1500
also get tough questions.

1359
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,740
0,480 510,1230
Alright so.

1360
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,810
0,210 210,720 750,1350 1350,1470 1470,2070
The first category of questions

1361
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,270
0,240 240,360 360,630 630,1200 1440,2460
kind of falls under questions

1362
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:59,060
0,660 660,930 930,1170 1170,1860 2310,2790
specifically about map, reduce, um,

1363
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:01,220
0,270 270,540 540,840 840,1530 1710,2130
so some more complex tasks

1364
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,150
0,240 240,360 360,630 630,840 840,930
that you might want to

1365
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:04,220
0,240 240,900 900,1470 1680,1950 1950,2070
use produce for a it's

1366
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,180
0,300 300,510 510,540 540,870 870,960
actually used a lot in

1367
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,770
0,570 570,750 750,930 930,1200 1200,1590
ml, or like data mining,

1368
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:09,770
0,900 930,1920 2040,2550 2550,2700 2700,3000
statistical applications, um I linked

1369
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:11,260
0,390 390,1080
here too.

1370
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,180
0,480 510,870 870,1170 1170,1410 1410,1800
A zoo which is a

1371
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,250
0,900 1110,1380 1380,1770 1770,1830 1830,2010
implements map reduce a lot

1372
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,060
0,60 60,300 300,450 450,630 630,810
of people use it to

1373
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,770
0,540 570,780 780,1020 1020,1080 1080,1710
run these types of tasks,

1374
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,740
0,450 450,750 750,870 870,1800 2100,2490
um, and for example, here's

1375
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:21,900
0,660
a.

1376
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,360
0,900 1260,1680 1710,2100 2100,2340 2340,2460
Simple, or maybe not so

1377
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,390
0,390 390,570 570,1320 1350,2400 2400,3030
simple, but basically matrix multiplication

1378
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:28,650
0,600 600,750 750,900 900,1020 1020,1260
example of how you would

1379
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,060
0,210 210,390 390,600 600,810 810,1380
read that using map reduce.

1380
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:34,160
0,660 870,1290 1290,1650 1710,2100 2340,2820
A second like you for

1381
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,660
0,240 240,630 630,720 720,810 810,1500
full tolerance of the coordinator,

1382
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,010
0,90 90,450 450,900 900,1050 1050,1350
the paper proposes a very

1383
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:40,600
0,690 930,1500 1530,2100 2100,3060
simple a check pointing.

1384
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:42,520
0,720 720,840 840,1110 1110,1260 1260,1530
Mechanism in which you'll just

1385
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,500
0,300 300,570 570,1080 1080,1260 1260,1980
start up a new coordinator

1386
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,880
0,360 360,480 480,780 780,960 960,1380
using the last check, pointed

1387
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,620
0,480 930,1290 1290,1440 1440,1560 1560,1740
state and in some ways

1388
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,760
0,120 120,240 240,600 600,810 810,1140
this is a very natural

1389
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,680
0,570 630,810 810,1110 1110,1410 1410,1920
design for macro juice because

1390
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,570
0,360 360,480 480,1080 1290,1620 1620,1890
everything is determined today there's

1391
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:55,120
0,570 930,1560 1590,1770 1770,2310 2310,2550
no I'm the coordinator really

1392
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,170
0,300 300,450 450,570 570,750 750,1050
doesn't have that much state

1393
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:56,980
0,90 90,360 360,510 510,570 570,810
to hold all I need

1394
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,970
0,90 90,270 270,480 480,780 780,990
to know is which half

1395
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,470
0,540 540,630 630,810 810,1050 1050,1500
finished and which has happened,

1396
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:01,020
0,840
um.

1397
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,860
0,390 390,600 600,870 870,1110 1110,1650
So you could use wrath,

1398
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:05,350
0,150 150,540 540,1050 1290,2040 2040,2460
of course to enable fault

1399
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,020
0,510 510,660 660,1110 1860,2370 2400,2670
tolerance and have a set

1400
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,340
0,90 90,720 720,900 900,1020 1020,1320
of coordinators that all agree

1401
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,650
0,480 750,1260 1290,1830 1830,2160 2160,2310
on the commands issued so

1402
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,720
0,420 420,540 540,720 720,1200 1200,2070
far and their current stay,

1403
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,100
0,660 690,840 840,990 990,1260 1260,1350
but in some ways it

1404
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,750
0,210 210,300 300,630 630,1260 1260,1650
seems a little overkill for.

1405
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,950
0,510 510,660 660,1470 1950,2100 2100,2370
I'm the coordinator for something

1406
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,570
0,180 180,390 390,720 720,1050 1050,1620
that's more state ful, it's

1407
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,460
0,660 660,870 870,1080 1080,1410 1410,1680
like a key value store

1408
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,020
0,60 60,390 390,1020 1020,1290 1290,1560
or something, it's much more

1409
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,460
0,450 450,570 570,750 750,960 960,1440
natural to use a raft.

1410
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,440
0,570 600,1140 1230,1470 1470,1680 1680,2040
Um, so some other questions

1411
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,940
0,150 150,270 270,840 840,1110 1110,1500
about our produce the shuffle

1412
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,590
0,180 180,540 540,660 660,1020 1110,1650
or combine with that, when

1413
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:36,460
0,150 150,240 240,630 630,720 720,870
does it happen and what

1414
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,410
0,180 180,300 300,660 660,1200 1290,1950
does it do so combining

1415
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,120
0,150 150,690 720,1320 1320,1440 1440,1710
a curse like right after

1416
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,260
0,60 60,270 270,600 600,1050 1050,1140
the map functions applied for

1417
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,940
0,600 630,870 870,1350 1350,1470 1470,1680
example in combining the word

1418
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,710
0,480 480,690 690,930 930,1380 1380,1770
counts of a particular word

1419
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:45,850
0,390 390,600 600,660 660,870 870,1020
because having a lot of

1420
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:47,320
0,450 450,810 900,1050 1050,1200 1200,1470
entries that you know like

1421
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,870
0,330 330,1020 1650,1860 1860,2220 2370,2550
the one you could you

1422
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:51,550
0,210 210,600 600,960 960,1140 1140,1680
know, combine them and then

1423
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:53,050
0,420 420,930 930,1230 1230,1350 1350,1440
write only that to the

1424
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:54,340
0,450 450,930
immediate file.

1425
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,570
0,360 360,1080 1080,1530 1980,2340 2340,2820
Our intermediate file a sorting

1426
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,100
0,390 390,450 450,570 570,1020 1020,1530
occurs at the reduce, after

1427
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,270
0,420 420,540 540,990 990,1080 1080,1170
all the outputs of the

1428
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,710
0,270 270,390 390,750 990,1320 1320,1440
map are read by the

1429
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:02,860
0,600
producer.

1430
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,070
0,630 630,840 840,960 960,1020 1020,1530
Um, let's see, um successors

1431
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,810
0,210 210,750 750,930 930,1140 1140,1740
may produce yeah so actually

1432
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,460
0,390 390,660 660,990 990,1470 1470,1650
I'm not super familiar with

1433
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:09,360
0,180 180,450 450,570 570,720 720,900
it, but you can look

1434
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,680
0,150 150,540 540,780 780,1110 1110,1320
at stuff like Google cloud

1435
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,440
0,330 330,870 1110,1740 2010,2190 2190,2760
data flow a and other

1436
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,140
0,240 240,600 690,1380 1380,1740 1740,2700
sort of directed graph computations

1437
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,450
0,870 900,1410 1410,1800 1800,2130 2130,2250
where inputs flow into a

1438
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:19,710
0,450 450,600 600,990 990,1110 1110,1260
node so you can think

1439
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:20,610
0,90 90,300 300,630 630,720 720,900
of as grab and then

1440
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:22,050
0,420 450,720 720,1020 1020,1320 1320,1440
they might flow out to

1441
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,970
0,300 300,780 810,1110 1110,1380 1470,1920
other nodes and that node

1442
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:24,870
0,150 150,210 210,600 600,720 720,900
in the middle of that

1443
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,240
0,780 810,900 900,1320 1320,1620 1620,2370
performs for example map computation

1444
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,340
0,150 150,600 600,1170 1170,1650 1830,2100
and produces intermediate data is

1445
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,450
0,210 210,450 450,540 540,900 900,1110
then sent to other like

1446
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,590
0,450 450,600 600,900 900,1020 1020,1110
reduce or that in the

1447
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:33,810
0,390 540,1050 1050,1350 1350,1650 1650,2220
graph, so it's a um.

1448
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,920
0,510 510,990 990,1200 1200,1380 1380,1500
Interesting way, it's like a

1449
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,270
0,390 420,780 780,1020 1020,1170 1170,1350
data data flow way to

1450
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,460
0,180 180,660 660,900 900,1680
think about Mac reduce.

1451
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:40,950
0,420 420,510 510,690 690,840 840,1050
And I'm sure that there's

1452
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:43,200
0,450 450,780 810,1020 1020,1410 1470,2250
others that I'm not necessarily

1453
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,880
0,180 180,390 390,750 1230,1470 1470,1680
like that where I did

1454
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,650
0,480 480,870 930,1350 1350,1590 1590,1770
not want one maybe one

1455
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:47,880
0,150 150,360 360,840 840,1050 1050,1230
of them spark which will

1456
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,400
0,180 180,450 450,900
read later about.

1457
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,650
0,510 510,1080 1110,1440 1440,1740 1740,1950
Yeah so, but I I

1458
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,120
0,480 570,870 870,1170 1170,1350 1350,1470
like the graph way of

1459
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,770
0,300 300,720 720,870 870,1320 1350,1650
thinking about our juice, because

1460
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:58,580
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,570 570,810
right now we're only really

1461
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,980
0,270 270,600 600,780 780,1470 1620,2400
thinking about a two-step operation

1462
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,270
0,270 270,360 360,660 690,1170 1170,1290
where it could actually be

1463
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:04,370
0,450 660,780 780,1140 1320,1770 1770,2100
like you know many many

1464
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:05,360
0,570
stuffs.

1465
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,610
0,630 660,750 750,960 960,1140 1140,1350
Um, oh yeah, then how

1466
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:10,360
0,420 420,930 930,1440 1440,2010
input practitioner practice so.

1467
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,560
0,450 450,1350
Usually because.

1468
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:14,240
0,210 210,570 570,1110 1110,1350 1350,1590
The input space is very

1469
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,250
0,600 600,1110 1110,1260 1260,1620 1620,2010
application, specific and output spaces,

1470
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,770
0,300 300,870 870,1650 1680,2130 2130,2520
also application specific, um, it's

1471
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:20,180
0,330 330,480 480,600 600,810 810,1410
really up to the programmer

1472
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:23,390
0,300 330,1290 1680,1920 1920,2580 2580,3210
to specify a there's sometimes

1473
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,020
0,1170
a.

1474
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:31,400
0,450 450,660 660,750 750,1050 1050,1350
Natural defense for example make

1475
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,310
0,480 750,1530 1590,1830 1830,2220 2220,2910
a local a major computation,

1476
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:35,090
0,150 150,240 240,390 390,450 450,780
then you want to combine

1477
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,770
0,300 330,720 840,1380 1380,1530 1530,1680
them or so on, so

1478
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:38,930
0,570 600,1140 1200,1650 1650,1860 1860,2160
forth, um, or you could

1479
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,010
0,210 210,510 510,690 690,870 870,960
if it's just like an

1480
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:42,020
0,600 600,1260 1260,1440 1440,1620 1620,2010
enormous document or like enormous

1481
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,090
0,300 540,1080 1110,1680 1740,1980 1980,2070
text text files, you can

1482
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,050
0,210 210,450 450,540 540,720 720,960
just split it up into

1483
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,100
0,120 120,390 390,660 660,780 780,1050
a reasonable size of work,

1484
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,690
0,150 150,300 300,450 450,780 930,1590
so you know like applying

1485
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:48,890
0,90 90,330 330,750 750,1020 1020,1200
the map function is going

1486
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:50,750
0,90 90,300 300,900 1050,1530 1530,1860
to take forever and also

1487
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,010
0,390 390,750 810,930 930,1200 1200,1260
depends on the size of

1488
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,090
0,150 150,660 660,780 780,930 930,1080
your cluster, so how many

1489
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,200
0,360 360,480 480,720
workers you have.

1490
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:55,680
0,570
I'm.

1491
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,620
0,420 420,630 630,900 900,1080 1080,1320
So some further map reduce

1492
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,990
0,750 1080,1320 1320,1440 1440,1980 1980,2370
questions, why do macro files

1493
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,670
0,420 420,630 630,870 870,1020 1020,1680
locally, so in the paper,

1494
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,290
0,300 300,420 420,1200 1230,1380 1380,1590
this is because at that

1495
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:06,510
0,270 270,390 390,720 720,1890 1890,2220
time, the network bandwidth was

1496
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,960
0,210 210,1050
their bottleneck.

1497
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,200
0,240 240,360 360,480 480,690 690,1020
That's why they don't use

1498
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,910
0,480 480,690 690,960 960,1200 1200,1710
gfs, they only use gfs

1499
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,260
0,120 120,510 510,1170 1200,1770
to right the um.

1500
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,470
0,360 390,570 570,840 840,930 930,1230
Yeah to write the output

1501
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:18,480
0,480
files.

1502
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,770
0,390 390,720 720,1410 1410,1560 1560,2010
Our leaders necessary for distributed

1503
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:24,140
0,630 720,1170 1170,1890 1920,2490
systems, not necessarily, um.

1504
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,360
0,990 990,1290 1290,1530 1530,1680 1680,2100
They're like think of Bitcoin

1505
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,070
0,240 240,570 570,1200 1200,1620 1620,1710
like other decentralized systems in

1506
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:29,420
0,420 510,720 720,810 810,1140 1140,1350
which all the nodes sort

1507
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,580
0,150 150,450 450,1020 1020,1410 1590,2160
of perform competition and some

1508
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:32,750
0,330 330,690 690,840 840,1020 1020,1170
random node or like some

1509
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:33,800
0,180 180,270 270,360 360,720 720,1050
node in the network is

1510
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,570
0,570 570,930 960,1380 1380,1650 1650,1770
responsible for committing that so

1511
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:36,650
0,210 210,300 300,630 630,870 870,1080
there are definitely more like

1512
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:38,540
0,780 780,1500
egalitarian designs.

1513
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:41,490
0,780 1170,1770 1770,1950 1950,2460 2460,2580
Um, again, our challenge was

1514
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:42,870
0,330 330,570 570,840 840,1080 1080,1380
actually to run map reduce

1515
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:44,910
0,360 450,810 810,1230 1230,1560 1560,2040
on like actual different servers

1516
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:47,730
0,330 330,900 1770,2040 2040,2550 2580,2820
rather than what we kind

1517
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:48,660
0,210 210,450 450,540 540,810 810,930
of had you do in

1518
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,090
0,90 90,600 1020,1650 1920,2310 2310,2430
the lab and so in

1519
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:52,020
0,180 180,360 360,480 480,750 750,930
order to do this like

1520
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,040
0,150 150,630
you just.

1521
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,450
0,360 360,420 420,660 660,1260 1260,1410
Instead of using sockets to

1522
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:56,730
0,750 960,1350 1350,1890 1890,2070 2070,2280
communicate a over for like

1523
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:58,950
0,330 330,870 1110,1320 1320,1650 1680,2220
dark seas, you would use

1524
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,900
0,240 240,720 720,1170 1170,1740 1740,1950
like tcp ivey, basically like

1525
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,120
0,660 990,1740
normal, um.

1526
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:05,380
0,330 330,600 600,810 810,1170 1170,1950
Like over the network communication

1527
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,720
0,540 540,750 750,1170 1410,1800 1800,1890
and you would use a

1528
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,370
0,300 300,540 540,990 990,1230 1230,1650
shared file system like together,

1529
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,230
0,480 480,840 870,1320 1320,1470 1470,1860
so the colon I think

1530
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,340
0,180 180,270 270,510 510,690 690,1080
all of you have access

1531
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,870
0,150 150,660 780,1140 1140,1260 1260,1530
to thea if at least

1532
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:16,240
0,210 210,900 930,1230 1230,1620 1770,2370
your MIT and you know

1533
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,740
0,420 420,690 690,810 810,1140 1140,1440
S H to multiple athena

1534
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,270
0,480 480,660 660,960 960,1050 1050,1530
machines and use a fs

1535
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,970
0,210 210,570 960,1800 1830,2250 2310,2700
which is the file share

1536
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:24,480
0,330 330,840 840,1470 1470,2010
files, sympathy noises too.

1537
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:26,600
0,900 900,1050 1050,1170 1170,1500 1500,1650
Basically, you can access your

1538
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,890
0,360 360,480 480,840 840,1080 1080,1290
files on athena from any

1539
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:30,530
0,510 1020,1590 1620,2310 2310,2430 2430,2640
machine, a similarly you could

1540
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,610
0,150 150,300 300,510 510,870 870,1080
do the same thing by

1541
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:33,620
0,450 450,990 990,1620 1620,1740 1740,2010
wrenching aws instances and using

1542
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,890
0,210 210,720 1320,2010 2250,2850 3000,3270
s three but we didn't

1543
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:38,030
0,420 420,570 570,690 690,960 960,1140
expect you to spend any

1544
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,100
0,330 330,810 930,1380 1380,1530 1530,2070
money to run our lab.

1545
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,620
0,330 330,540 540,840 840,1320 1320,1440
Right, so some questions that

1546
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,090
0,210 210,570 570,720 720,990 990,1470
came about just like general

1547
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:47,530
0,210 210,570 570,720 720,1110 1200,1440
code design, so we've some

1548
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:48,790
0,120 120,360 360,540 540,1080 1080,1260
of these we've discussed as

1549
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:51,460
0,420 840,1650 1770,2190 2190,2370 2370,2670
well so label was pretty

1550
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,140
0,600 630,990 990,1200 1200,1380 1380,1680
small lab two is going

1551
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,220
0,90 90,570
to be.

1552
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,290
0,420 420,960 990,1890 1890,1980 1980,2070
Much larger especially as you

1553
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:57,460
0,120 120,180 180,300 300,570 570,1170
get to the later stages

1554
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,710
0,870 1290,1650 1650,1890 1890,2070 2070,2190
and as live three and

1555
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,670
0,210 210,420 420,570 570,840 840,960
live for come along as

1556
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,840
0,360 1020,1650
well, and.

1557
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:04,520
0,300 300,570 660,960 960,1110 1110,1530
One thing that I personally

1558
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,020
0,330 330,600 600,1080 1080,1290 1290,1500
find very handy is just

1559
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,300
0,720
separate.

1560
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,650
0,360 360,660 660,750 750,1170 1170,1350
Different chunks of code by

1561
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,180
0,210 210,960 1050,1980
their purpose, so.

1562
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:12,710
0,480 480,780 780,1080 1080,1200 1200,1380
Um, and also in how

1563
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:14,960
0,240 240,1200 1440,1740 1740,2040 2040,2250
I implement each step of

1564
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,360
0,570 600,1230 1320,1740 1740,2250 2250,2400
my code, so separating them

1565
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,710
0,270 270,510 510,630 630,1140 1140,1350
out by for example a

1566
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:20,960
0,810 810,1380 1470,1620 1620,2130 2130,2250
sees and the sellers and

1567
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,570
0,600 930,1380 1380,1650 1650,2160 2160,2610
handlers and feel free to

1568
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,820
0,720 720,1110 1110,1290 1290,1650 1650,2250
actually separate these out physically

1569
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,530
0,150 150,480 480,960 1080,1530 1530,1710
in different files, um that

1570
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:29,300
0,420 570,990 1110,1410 1410,1650 1650,1770
won't like that's fine for

1571
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,920
0,90 90,570 570,960 960,1350 1380,1620
a test and it will

1572
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,320
0,420 420,660 660,1110 1500,2070 2160,2400
probably help you I'm like

1573
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,550
0,210 210,450 450,840 840,960 960,1230
not have thousands of lines

1574
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,020
0,60 60,390 390,480 480,900 930,1470
of code in one gigantic

1575
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:36,820
0,450
file.

1576
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,280
0,630
AH.

1577
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,960
0,510 510,1080 1080,1440 1440,1590 1590,1680
I I personally like to

1578
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,730
0,240 240,360 360,900 900,1020 1020,1770
put all definitions of state

1579
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:45,030
0,630 630,780 780,1230 1320,2280 2520,3240
together and then functions are

1580
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:46,710
0,240 240,450 450,540 540,1050 1050,1260
like sort of separate but

1581
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:48,540
0,300 300,480 480,810 810,1380 1380,1830
that's my personal preference, um.

1582
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:51,350
0,510 510,690 690,990 990,1320 1320,1440
Factoring out common pieces of

1583
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:52,760
0,270 270,480 480,960 960,1080 1080,1410
code into functions will also

1584
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,800
0,120 120,420 420,990 1020,1350 1350,2040
be very helpful for example

1585
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,020
0,360 360,630 630,1470 1890,2070 2070,2190
every single RBC, you will

1586
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:58,130
0,270 270,360 360,840 840,960 960,1110
get in rap, you need

1587
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,330
0,60 60,300 300,480 480,720 720,1200
to check for sale term

1588
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:01,520
0,750 810,1140 1140,1380 1380,1590 1590,2070
so putting all that logic

1589
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,870
0,180 180,600 600,1110 1110,1260 1260,1350
so that resets all the

1590
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:04,370
0,330 330,780 780,870 870,1290 1290,1500
state properly and everything into

1591
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:05,510
0,360 360,720 720,810 810,960 960,1140
one function that you just

1592
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:08,540
0,540 810,1440 1470,2160 2160,2910 2910,3030
call will help because you

1593
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,320
0,270 270,390 390,480 480,660 660,780
know you don't want to

1594
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,660
0,390 390,750 750,1020 1230,1800 1800,2340
accidentally forget to reset your

1595
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:13,130
0,420 420,690 690,840 840,1050 1050,1440
election time or like reset

1596
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,660
0,360 360,690 690,1260 1590,2190
voted for something, um.

1597
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:18,060
0,330 330,450 450,840 840,1110 1110,1170
Although you should reset the

1598
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,020
0,300 300,510 510,600 600,780 780,960
election time are so don't

1599
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,430
0,90 90,480 510,690 690,1110 1260,1410
do that that was an

1600
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:21,330
0,330 330,420 420,690 690,810 810,900
example I pulled off the

1601
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:23,460
0,150 150,210 210,600 690,1530 1920,2130
top of my head and

1602
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,230
0,540 570,1140 1140,1410 1410,1620 1620,1770
also finally have a good

1603
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,210
0,720 720,1080 1080,1380 1380,1860 1860,1980
environment with auto complete or

1604
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:28,500
0,210 210,390 390,540 540,630 630,1290
like being able to search

1605
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,000
0,300 300,600 600,1110 1110,1170 1170,1320
for certain keywords in your

1606
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,170
0,360 360,510 510,660 660,960 960,1170
code, and so forth can

1607
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,740
0,240 240,780 870,2100
help a lot.

1608
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,180
0,570 570,840 840,990 990,1200 1200,1410
So if you need any

help setting this like come

1610
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:37,760
0,90 90,360 360,840 840,1020 1020,1410
to office hours or there's

1611
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:39,740
0,330 330,420 420,870 870,1470 1500,1890
tons of tutorials online, you

1612
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,060
0,240 240,450 450,690 690,1110 1110,1320
can look up a good

1613
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,310
0,570 840,1290 1440,1620 1620,1800 1800,2250
editor but it's not necessary,

1614
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,870
0,120 120,510 510,690 690,1290 1290,1560
it's definitely not necessary, but

1615
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:46,370
0,150 150,450 480,840 840,1080 1080,1500
it could it does help

1616
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,490
0,210 210,660 690,960 960,1170 1170,1470
and then yeah so far

1617
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,960
0,180 180,630 630,1020 1020,1410 1410,1470
s housing, go decrease the

1618
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,280
0,180 180,270 270,480 480,870 870,1320
amount of time students spend

1619
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,200
0,630 840,1110 1110,1320 1320,1530 1530,1920
bugging so I've never actually

1620
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,550
0,480 480,570 570,960 960,1140 1140,1350
implemented the last c plus

1621
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,080
0,360 360,540 540,900 900,1050 1050,1530
plus, but according to friends

1622
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:57,800
0,330
like.

1623
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,110
0,510 690,1440 1470,2040 2070,2550 2550,3030
Well, the one huge advantage

1624
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:02,520
0,120 120,390 390,810 810,1080 1080,1410
of go is its memory

1625
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,070
0,780 990,1350 1350,1680 1680,2010 2010,2550
management so uses garbage collection

1626
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:06,000
0,150 150,330 330,540 540,690 690,930
and you'll have to deal

1627
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,580
0,180 180,810 1080,1200 1200,1620 2280,2580
with like you know there

1628
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:09,990
0,180 180,840 840,1140 1140,1260 1260,1410
are pointers but you don't

1629
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:10,650
0,90 90,180 180,420 420,540 540,660
have to deal with them

1630
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:11,370
0,90 90,180 180,390 390,600 600,720
in the same way you

1631
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:12,420
0,300 300,510 510,690 690,840 840,1050
would see your c plus

1632
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,840
0,450 900,1380 1410,1620 1620,1980
plus, um, so like.

1633
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:15,680
0,120 120,270 270,360 360,570 570,750
I don't know how many

1634
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,060
0,90 90,210 210,390 390,630 630,1380
of you run into cycles

1635
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:18,860
0,270 270,630 630,960 990,1230 1230,1770
so far but I'm guessing

1636
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:19,910
0,360 360,570 570,630 630,810 810,1050
very few of you or

1637
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:20,870
0,120 120,300 300,570 570,810 810,960
they were very easy to

1638
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:23,680
0,450 720,1530 1650,2340
fix, and this.

1639
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,540
0,660 660,960 960,1110 1110,1500 1500,1620
Definitely makes it easier to

1640
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,400
0,870 1020,1170 1170,1350 1350,1590 1590,1860
debug or they're just certain

1641
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,240
0,300 300,390 390,630 630,720 720,840
types of bugs that you

1642
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,320
0,180 180,330 330,480 480,780 780,1080
don't need to worry about.

1643
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,670
0,330 330,360 360,450 450,540 540,960
Sorry I have a question,

1644
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,620
0,480 600,990 990,1140 1140,1350 1350,1500
yeah this is like a

1645
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,960
0,450 450,660 660,1140 1140,1590 1980,2340
more go specific question, um,

1646
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,340
0,420 510,810 810,1140 1140,1260 1260,1380
but um when you have

1647
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,810
0,120 120,690 690,990 1050,1230 1230,1470
a function that can take

1648
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:40,490
0,360 390,930 1110,1350 1350,1530 1530,1680
in a let's say you

1649
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:41,780
0,120 120,300 300,690 960,1140 1140,1290
have like a you have

1650
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,070
0,270 270,570 570,930 930,1200 1200,1290
a pen entries are and

1651
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:44,780
0,60 60,240 240,360 360,840 1110,1710
you also have like a

1652
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,610
0,720 720,1020 1020,1350 1350,1590 1590,1650
request vote art both of

1653
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:47,990
0,120 120,330 330,450 450,900 900,1380
them have a term variable

1654
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:49,430
0,690 720,990 990,1080 1080,1170 1170,1440
inside but when you pass

1655
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:50,960
0,90 90,180 180,330 330,1020
it to a function.

1656
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,370
0,150 150,240 240,570 750,1260 1260,1410
How do you tell the

1657
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:53,450
0,360 360,570 570,690 690,930 930,1080
function, that's like hey I

1658
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,760
0,510 600,780 780,1350 1530,1980 1980,2310
expect a structure that has

1659
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,600
0,210 210,690 690,1320
a term field.

1660
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:02,000
0,120 120,300 300,1140
Is that possible.

1661
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,050
0,330 330,810 810,1860 1860,2100 2130,2850
So you define the types

1662
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:07,510
0,480 540,1170 1410,1890 1890,2190 2190,2460
right, so it's like any

1663
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:09,000
0,960
other.

1664
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:10,470
0,450 450,780 780,1050 1080,1260 1260,1380
Type your um, when you

1665
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:11,670
0,300 300,600 600,720 720,1080 1080,1200
pass into the function, the

1666
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:13,620
0,330 330,1050 1230,1410 1410,1860 1860,1950
function expects an argument of

1667
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,160
0,120 120,570 570,1050
a particular type.

1668
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:16,930
0,540 540,900 930,1260 1260,1500 1500,1740
And but that's type of

1669
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,520
0,750 900,1110 1110,1290 1290,1410 1410,1470
yeah yeah let's say I

1670
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,840
0,210 210,300 300,630 630,960 960,1320
want to share one function

1671
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,690
0,540 570,870 870,1530 2280,2430 2430,2850
across both types I believe

1672
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:24,250
0,150 150,330 330,510 510,630 630,1560
he can use an interface

1673
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,220
0,450 450,510 510,750 750,1410
but I'm not sure.

1674
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:28,580
0,330 330,390 390,570 570,1140 1650,2010
So I tried to but

1675
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:29,810
0,180 180,270 270,450 450,780 780,1230
when I do dot term

1676
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:31,310
0,120 120,690 1080,1200 1200,1350 1350,1500
it says I don't know

1677
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:32,930
0,330 330,900 1020,1200 1200,1440 1440,1620
this field or lucky, this

1678
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:34,490
0,180 180,600 1080,1230 1230,1440 1440,1560
one says I think you

1679
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:35,870
0,180 180,270 270,690 690,1020 1140,1380
need to convert it or

1680
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:37,640
0,150 150,300 300,840 1230,1650 1650,1770
you need to still have

1681
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,050
0,540 540,660 660,810 810,1200 1230,1410
casting I can't remember but

1682
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:41,270
0,150 150,240 240,450 450,1110 1410,2220
there's a way to coerce

1683
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:42,590
0,150 150,240 240,360 360,930 930,1020
you have to typecast it

1684
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:43,850
0,450 450,540 540,660 660,810 810,1260
back, you know to whatever

1685
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:45,760
0,510 510,720 720,1440
obstruct you wanna.

1686
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,430
0,420 1140,1590 1590,1680 1680,2190 2190,2670
Actually, like you basically need

1687
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:51,370
0,120 120,1200 1200,1860 2190,2640 2700,2940
to talk go that by

1688
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:53,140
0,150 150,810 810,1050 1050,1530 1530,1770
the time I actually use

1689
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:54,610
0,210 210,840 840,1080 1080,1260 1260,1470
this variable, it is of

1690
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,160
0,180 180,690 690,1080
a particular type.

1691
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,890
0,270 270,510 540,780 780,990 1020,1260
Got it, thank you so

1692
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:58,910
0,300 300,570 570,750 750,840 840,1020
one thing if you want

1693
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,230
0,120 120,510 510,630 630,1080 1080,1320
to reuse the function for

1694
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:02,150
0,480 480,750 750,1260 1470,1680 1680,1920
multiple different types, you can

1695
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:03,920
0,360 360,480 480,600 600,1290 1320,1770
pass in an interface, but

1696
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,940
0,150 150,420 420,720 720,930 930,1020
you might also need to

1697
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:07,120
0,360 360,630 630,750 750,1530
pass in for example.

1698
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,040
0,840 900,1350
A like.

1699
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:10,960
0,480 480,690 690,990 990,1410 1410,1770
I.e no more board something

1700
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,280
0,150 150,450 450,750 870,1080 1080,1320
that tells it like hey

1701
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,000
0,180 180,270 270,480 480,540 540,720
this is going to be

1702
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,930
0,240 240,540 540,630 630,840 840,930
this type, and then you

1703
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,550
0,120 120,210 210,570 570,750 750,1620
need to cast that interface

1704
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,050
0,540 540,660 660,900 900,1110 1110,1380
into the right type before

1705
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:18,560
0,120 120,330 330,570
you use it.

1706
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,080
0,720
Okay.

1707
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:21,950
0,60 60,210 210,270 270,600 600,870
I think the way people

1708
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,150
0,240 240,480 480,720 720,870 870,1200
usually handle this is by

1709
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,220
0,360 360,810 810,960 960,1350 1350,1410
putting setters and getters in

1710
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:26,870
0,90 90,810 990,1170 1170,1290 1290,1650
the interface, you don't actually

1711
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:28,970
0,240 240,510 510,1230 1290,1500 1500,2100
know which type it is

1712
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,920
0,420 420,1170 1170,1290 1290,1500 1500,1920
in actuality, you just access

1713
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,300
0,210 210,780 810,1260 1260,1950
the variable using interface.

1714
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:35,300
0,420
Yeah.

1715
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:37,900
0,390
But.

1716
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:39,790
0,450 480,690 690,990 990,1230 1230,1530
Yeah I don't think it

1717
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,980
0,330 330,750 750,1320 1320,1620 1620,1860
you should need to use

1718
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:44,440
0,960 990,1260 1260,1530 1530,1740 1740,2460
interfaces that much in draft

1719
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,550
0,120 120,360 360,570 570,810 810,1110
I don't think I used

1720
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:46,420
0,150 150,300 300,630 630,780 780,870
it all other than the

1721
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:49,360
0,630 750,1500 1530,1740 1740,2430
command which is provided.

1722
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:50,760
0,540
HMM.

1723
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:55,780
0,540 570,1140 1350,1470 1470,1950 1980,2370
Yeah, like I guess factoring

1724
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:56,740
0,120 120,360 360,630 630,720 720,960
out common pieces of code

1725
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,000
0,120 120,420 420,780 780,870 870,1260
is good unless it adds

1726
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,820
0,450 450,1200
additional complexity.

1727
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:01,360
0,480
I'm.

1728
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,030
0,120 120,270 270,360 360,630 630,810
A like I wouldn't try

1729
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:05,730
0,240 240,690 690,1320 1680,2430 2430,2700
and force your types to

1730
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,470
0,780 780,900 900,1170 1170,1500 1530,1740
all be able to run

1731
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:08,610
0,270 270,360 360,570 570,900 900,1140
on the same function like

1732
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:09,870
0,60 60,450 450,720 720,840 840,1260
it might just be simpler

1733
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:12,270
0,270 390,840 840,1290 1290,1710 1710,2400
to two slightly different functions.

1734
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:14,110
0,240 240,330 330,450 450,750 750,960
Or, if the only like

1735
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,250
0,330 330,540 540,720 720,990 990,1110
shared piece you're using is

1736
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,270
0,120 120,390 390,480 480,600 600,1020
the term you can have

1737
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:17,950
0,120 120,390 390,810 810,1260 1260,1500
the same function taken just

1738
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:19,150
0,60 60,480 480,750 750,990 990,1200
the term and in both

1739
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:20,860
0,450 450,960 960,1110 1110,1440 1440,1710
cases passin the dot term

1740
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:23,540
0,240 240,660 1050,1560 1560,1950
of the structure using.

1741
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:29,120
0,720 720,870 870,1620 1620,1830 1830,2100
Alright some other code design

1742
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:33,740
0,720 1410,2070 2280,3000 3150,3570 3570,4620
questions museum, once when separating

1743
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,870
0,180 180,600 600,1110 1110,1680 1680,2130
the code into multiple files,

1744
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:38,330
0,150 150,360 360,720 720,1950 2010,2460
is there naming conventional like

1745
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:40,370
0,750 750,1290 1350,1620 1620,1740 1740,2040
required because when we make

1746
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:41,480
0,150 150,540 570,690 690,990 990,1110
the lab it seems like

1747
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,250
0,180 180,720 720,960 960,1410 1410,1770
it's copying the source file,

1748
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:44,240
0,150 150,270 270,450 450,630 630,990
so is there any naming

1749
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,680
0,780
convention.

1750
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,740
0,720 930,1080 1080,1350 1350,1470 1470,1680
Um, I mean I would

1751
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,180
0,180 180,420 420,630 630,1260 1290,1440
put them in raft, the

1752
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:51,310
0,300 300,990 1020,1590 1590,2010 2010,2130
raft folder but there's no

1753
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:52,450
0,300 300,750 750,930 930,1050 1050,1140
naming convention like you can

1754
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:53,470
0,150 150,270 270,540 540,930 930,1020
name your files whatever you

1755
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:54,960
0,420
want.

1756
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:57,140
0,450 870,1050 1050,1350 1350,1680 1680,1920
Okay, our grading scripts will

1757
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,630
0,690 720,1200 1200,1410 1410,2130 2130,2490
replace anything that's necessary for

1758
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,430
0,390 390,810 810,1200 1290,1740 1740,1800
or anything that belongs to

1759
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:04,580
0,90 90,450 450,1200 1320,2250 2580,3150
the testing framework, so the

1760
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:05,990
0,270 270,510 510,960 960,1170 1170,1380
con fig file or like

1761
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:07,910
0,120 120,420 420,1080 1200,1710 1710,1920
the test file anything that

1762
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,140
0,180 180,480 480,600 600,930 930,1230
you change in there will

1763
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:10,240
0,150 150,450 450,630
be wiped out.

1764
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,660
0,390
AH.

1765
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:13,720
0,630
Yeah.

1766
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,440
0,540 570,900 900,1170 1170,1530 1530,1890
Like also be slightly careful

1767
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,350
0,240 240,450 450,960 960,1860 2280,2910
about using external dependencies, um.

1768
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,420
0,330 330,570 570,810 810,930 930,1200
I ran into a couple

1769
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:23,740
0,360 360,630 630,1260 1260,1740
issues with grading some.

1770
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:26,140
0,450 450,990 1080,1380 1380,1830 1830,2400
Scripts ahead a external dependencies

1771
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:28,690
0,330 360,930 930,1470 1500,1890 1890,2550
like using some github package

1772
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,360
0,210 210,780 810,1680 1800,2340 2340,2640
go package, but those were

1773
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,530
0,270 270,420 420,630 630,930 960,1170
I was able to fix

1774
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:33,430
0,210 210,510 510,660 660,720 720,900
it, just be a little

1775
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:34,600
0,510 540,660 660,780 780,870 870,1170
careful if you do that.

1776
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:36,960
0,270 270,660 780,1230 1230,1350 1350,1830
But yeah create as many

1777
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,490
0,450 450,840 840,1080 1080,1380 1380,1530
docker files and wrapped as

1778
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,600
0,90 90,570
you want.

1779
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,020
0,810
I'm.

1780
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:44,540
0,240 240,630 630,1080 1080,2010 2190,2430
Yeah, so pointer versus a

1781
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:46,370
0,510 510,960 960,1290 1290,1440 1440,1830
value while passing by reference

1782
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:48,200
0,240 240,360 360,900 930,1560 1560,1830
can be cheaper because go

1783
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,090
0,390 390,600 990,1350 1350,1440 1440,1890
won't just copy the structure,

1784
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,840
0,270 270,480 480,930
um, this was.

1785
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:54,120
0,180 180,450 450,570 570,1260 1290,2100
This question was asked in

1786
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:57,060
0,660 660,1320 1500,2010 2010,2340 2340,2910
particular for why call takes

1787
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,830
0,510 540,1110 1110,1200 1200,1260 1260,1770
the arguments and the reply

1788
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:02,370
0,660 960,2010 2370,2670 2670,3240 3270,3540
as pointers and so yeah

1789
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,170
0,180 180,390 390,840 840,1320 1320,1800
those could be potentially extremely

1790
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:05,340
0,390 390,540 540,720 720,900 900,1170
large and so god doesn't

1791
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:06,570
0,150 150,270 270,630 630,900 1050,1230
have to copy them when

1792
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,650
0,90 90,270 270,360 360,750 750,1080
you call the function, that's

1793
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:09,480
0,120 120,300 300,780 1230,1560 1560,1830
the main reason a using

1794
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,860
0,390 390,510 510,900 900,990 990,1380
blocks and channels are possible,

1795
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,630
0,540 630,1260 1290,1500 1500,1680 1680,1770
yes, um, you'll give them

1796
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:14,580
0,180 180,240 240,720 1110,1770 1800,1950
both a raft so you

1797
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,600
0,150 150,570 570,750 750,900 900,1020
will definitely see how it's

1798
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,400
0,390
possible.

1799
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,400
0,150 150,390 390,570 570,720 720,840
Oh yeah, and then we're

1800
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,270
0,210 210,300 300,480 480,540 540,870
getting a lot of questions

1801
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:22,940
0,210 210,990 1020,1620 2160,2520 2520,2670
about China's um, so in

1802
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24,680
0,330 360,1080 1110,1230 1230,1440 1440,1740
map in the map, reduce

1803
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,570
0,360 390,510 510,930 930,1650 1710,1890
lab, the timeout was well,

1804
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:27,470
0,90 90,270 270,480 480,600 600,900
we gave you a set

1805
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:29,150
0,240 240,750 750,1140 1170,1320 1320,1680
ten seconds for the worker

1806
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:30,830
0,330 330,480 480,600 600,1020 1080,1680
tasks when they fail, but

1807
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:31,760
0,60 60,300 300,510 510,720 720,930
in terms of how long

1808
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,720
0,90 90,210 210,540 540,690 690,960
do you sleep and stuff

1809
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,860
0,330 330,600 600,840 840,1050 1050,1140
were pretty much able to

1810
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,460
0,270 270,570 570,840 840,1140
choose anything under that.

1811
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:37,170
0,570 570,1080 1080,1230 1230,1440 1440,1560
For rap, you have to

1812
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:38,190
0,390 390,660 660,780 780,840 840,1020
choose time out a little

1813
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:40,440
0,120 120,780 810,1620
more carefully and.

1814
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:41,820
0,180 180,510 510,660 660,960 960,1290
Our tests are like kind

1815
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:43,350
0,90 90,690 690,900 900,1170 1170,1530
of sensitive but not super

1816
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:45,240
0,630 750,1110 1110,1440 1440,1590 1590,1890
sensitive like you'll be opposite

1817
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,830
0,120 120,660 660,1110 1110,1320 1320,1590
for example probably be within

1818
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:47,940
0,90 90,330 330,450 450,900 900,1110
a range of one to

1819
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:50,220
0,840 840,1020 1020,1980 1980,2070 2070,2190
{100,,to} {200,milliseconds -} and be

1820
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,120
0,450 600,1410
fine, um.

1821
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:53,760
0,780
Yeah.

1822
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,230
0,510 510,660 660,900 900,1020 1020,1470
Um, in terms of choosing

1823
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:56,420
0,630
them.

1824
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,160
0,420
E.

1825
01:05:58,470 --> 01:06:00,480
0,600 600,1230 1230,1530 1530,1830 1830,2010
Probably helps to first think

1826
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,010
0,270 270,720 720,1050 1050,1410 1410,1530
about why you're waiting at

1827
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:03,380
0,390
all.

1828
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,630
0,690 720,930 930,1410 1410,1560 1560,2190
And for example in the

1829
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:07,850
0,330 330,870 900,1290 1290,1740 1740,1920
fore aft, your leader is

1830
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:09,300
0,240 240,960
sending heartbeat.

1831
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:11,310
0,420 420,570 570,1320 1530,1830 1830,1980
And your timeout is to

1832
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:12,750
0,480 480,720 720,840 840,1260 1260,1440
detect when the leader is

1833
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:14,560
0,450
dead.

1834
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:16,000
0,810
SO.

1835
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,990
0,270 270,540 540,660 660,870 870,990
You kind of want to

1836
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:18,220
0,210 210,300 300,720 720,870 870,1230
give the leader a couple

1837
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:19,660
0,510 510,600 600,900 900,1170 1170,1440
chances to tell you that

1838
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:22,690
0,150 150,780 900,2100 2490,2640 2640,3030
it's alive, otherwise you know

1839
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:24,340
0,240 240,480 480,1200 1200,1350 1350,1530
you'll just continuously think its

1840
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:26,860
0,360 570,1440 1740,2190 2190,2340 2340,2520
done so depending on what

1841
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,390
0,120 120,390 390,510 510,1020 1020,1530
you set your heartbeat timeout

1842
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:29,710
0,120 120,510 600,840 840,990 990,1320
to be or your heartbeat

1843
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:31,060
0,420 420,540 540,930 1050,1260 1260,1350
interval to be which I

1844
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:31,660
0,150 150,240 240,360 360,450 450,600
think will give you some

1845
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,680
0,480 480,600 600,720 720,900 900,1020
guidelines of it can't be

1846
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:33,730
0,300 300,480 480,600 600,780 780,1050
ten more than ten times

1847
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:35,440
0,150 150,630 930,1080 1080,1290 1290,1710
per second or something like

1848
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,000
0,510
that.

1849
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:38,840
0,480 480,720 720,960 960,1050 1050,1200
Depending on what you say

1850
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,400
0,150 150,540 540,1140 1170,1350 1350,1560
you're happy tummy you'll want

1851
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,060
0,120 120,360 360,480 480,540 540,660
your time out to be

1852
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:42,800
0,510 510,810 810,1140 1140,1500 1500,1740
something like pretty reasonable like

1853
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,750
0,480 480,810 810,1230 1500,1710 1710,1950
maybe allow for the chance

1854
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:45,440
0,90 90,300 300,420 420,540 540,690
to get two to three

1855
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,690
0,210 210,690 1350,1530 1530,2010 2040,2250
heart beads and then you'll

1856
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:49,490
0,150 150,240 240,1020 1020,1440 1440,1800
have to randomize some like.

1857
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,100
0,810 840,1500 1530,1740 1740,1860 1860,2100
Range because you don't want

1858
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,390
0,150 150,420 420,810 810,1080 1080,1290
all your service start left

1859
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:55,340
0,180 180,270 270,510 510,990 1530,1950
at the same time and

1860
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,840
0,120 120,270 270,600 600,720 720,1500
to do that you can

1861
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:58,070
0,120 120,270 270,450 450,600 600,960
you know like a range

1862
01:06:58,070 --> 01:06:59,080
0,510
of.

1863
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,320
0,780 780,1110
Maybe like.

1864
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:04,900
0,450 450,870 870,1200 1200,1980 2610,3270
Two to five heartbeats sometime

1865
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,030
0,210 210,600 600,990 1020,1410 1410,2130
out between there is reasonable,

1866
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:09,460
0,330 330,450 450,750 750,1290
but in terms of.

1867
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,470
0,240 240,630 630,1260 1290,1650 1650,2010
The test you'll see whether

1868
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:12,490
0,180 180,510 510,660 660,870 870,1020
you're sending too many our

1869
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:14,290
0,630 900,1200 1200,1380 1380,1560 1560,1800
PCs or too many bites

1870
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:15,100
0,60 60,240 240,360 360,450 450,810
are going over the network

1871
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,620
0,390 390,510 510,1080
as the tesco.

1872
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:19,270
0,180 180,450 450,1050 1170,1530 1530,1620
In later labs and you

1873
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:20,500
0,150 150,390 390,540 540,990 990,1230
can tweet your timeout very

1874
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,530
0,540 600,960 960,1470 1650,2430 2640,3030
easily, um, it's slightly a

1875
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:26,700
0,690 690,1380 1560,2610
implementation dependent so.

1876
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,140
0,270 270,540 540,720 720,1140 1140,1380
I can't tell you like,

1877
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:29,250
0,240 240,330 330,690 690,960 960,1110
what's the perfect number for

1878
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,080
0,390 720,1170 1200,1530 1530,1680 1680,1830
you, but thinking of it

1879
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,340
0,90 90,390 390,600 600,1080 1080,1260
in terms of why am

1880
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,600
0,90 90,510 510,900 1020,1170 1170,1260
I typing out in the

1881
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,730
0,240 240,840 960,1410 1560,1890 1890,2130
first place and how many

1882
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:36,570
0,150 150,510 510,570 570,660 660,840
are PCs do I want

1883
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:37,920
0,90 90,330 330,540 540,900 1020,1350
to get from like other

1884
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,200
0,480 480,840 840,1440 1470,1950 1950,2280
servers before timeout is a

1885
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,160
0,240 240,600 600,660 660,870 870,960
good metric to keep in

1886
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,020
0,360
mind.

1887
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:44,860
0,930 930,1050 1050,1260 1260,1320 1320,1470
Hopefully, that helps a lot

1888
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,320
0,180 180,480 480,930
of time outs.

1889
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,400
0,660 660,930 930,1080 1080,1290 1290,1500
Um, okay, yeah, so some

1890
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,490
0,750 750,1470 1470,1920 2160,2790 2820,3090
implementation questions that a came

1891
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:52,990
0,300 330,870 870,960 960,1140 1140,1500
up about the map produced

1892
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:54,100
0,330 330,420 420,720 720,810 810,1110
lab and also the labs

1893
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:55,340
0,90 90,690
in general.

1894
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,720
0,780
SO.

1895
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:59,520
0,390 390,1050 1410,1890 1890,2130 2130,2550
Some people actually did implement

1896
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,750
0,360 360,630 630,810 810,990 990,1230
backup tasks which is pretty

1897
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:01,860
0,360 360,540 540,660 660,960 960,1110
cool and we definitely did

1898
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,390
0,210 210,630 630,1110 1170,1320 1320,1530
not require that for this

1899
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:06,400
0,630 1020,1680 1890,2460
lab a and.

1900
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:07,970
0,150 150,360 360,720 720,1020 1020,1320
I think something that was

1901
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:09,020
0,450 450,540 540,720 720,840 840,1050
important to keep in mind

1902
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,820
0,120 120,270 270,360 360,1020 1290,1800
is that the paper has

1903
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:13,400
0,270 270,330 330,1260 1320,2040 2070,2550
makes a distinction between starting

1904
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,140
0,600 600,690 690,1290
restarting a task.

1905
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:16,610
0,330 330,420 420,660 660,930 930,1470
Because a work has failed.

1906
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,400
0,570
And.

1907
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:20,670
0,540 540,630 630,1020 1020,1620 1860,2010
Issuing the task again to

1908
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:22,860
0,450 450,630 660,1020 1020,1560 1560,2190
speed up a lagging task

1909
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,960
0,450 540,870 870,1110 1110,1470 1470,2100
that the worker hasn't failed

1910
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:26,730
0,420 450,630 630,930 930,1020 1020,1350
but you want the task

1911
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:28,800
0,90 90,540 540,1200 1560,1920 1920,2070
to complete faster and some

1912
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,060
0,390 390,780 780,900 900,1140 1140,1260
backup tasks are used for

1913
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,710
0,120 120,780 930,1200 1200,1500 1500,1650
the ladder when tests are

1914
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:33,750
0,330 330,600 600,930 930,1230 1230,2040
haven't failed yet but there's

1915
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:36,450
0,300 300,510 510,1080 1620,2010 2010,2700
air just slow and timeout.

1916
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:38,710
0,300 300,630 630,1080 1080,1410 1410,1890
We start task when workers

1917
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:40,240
0,150 150,420 420,870 870,960 960,1530
are actually detected to fail,

1918
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:42,340
0,630 630,810 810,930 930,1620 1620,2010
so when the paper the

1919
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:44,500
0,600 600,930 930,1230 1230,1890 1890,2130
coordinator actually gets heartbeats from

1920
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,320
0,90 90,720 840,1920 1980,2280 2280,2820
the workers whereas in the

1921
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:48,760
0,390 390,540 540,690 690,1200 1200,1410
design that we propose for

1922
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,500
0,270 270,780 900,1260 1260,1470 1470,1740
your lab, we use time

1923
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,270
0,270 270,750 750,840 840,1470 1500,1770
outs both to detect that

1924
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:54,580
0,300 300,630 660,1200 1200,1740 1800,2310
worker has probably failed and

1925
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,500
0,450 450,600 600,1080 1080,1350 1350,1920
also to detect slow tasks,

1926
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:58,330
0,690 720,900 900,1080 1080,1500 1500,1740
so in some ways we

1927
01:08:58,330 --> 01:08:59,620
0,240 240,570 600,780 780,1050 1050,1290
make that we don't have

1928
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:01,600
0,150 150,900 1110,1410 1410,1590 1590,1980
that distinction, we just assume

1929
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,980
0,480 510,660 660,870 870,1230 1230,1380
that if this task has

1930
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:04,420
0,120 120,750 750,1050 1050,1260 1260,1440
been completed in this set

1931
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:05,980
0,90 90,660 720,1290 1290,1380 1380,1560
of time that you know

1932
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,150
0,360 360,690 690,780 780,1050 1050,1170
like probably the worker has

1933
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:08,050
0,330 330,390 390,600 600,690 690,900
failed or maybe it's just

1934
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:09,760
0,480 480,810 810,930 930,1230 1230,1710
insanely slow and let's reissue

1935
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,890
0,240 480,810 810,990 990,1440 1470,2130
it so that's why I'm.

1936
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:14,470
0,480 480,1170 1170,1470 1470,1740 1740,2100
Our labs don't really mention

1937
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:15,960
0,240 240,360 360,990
back at test.

1938
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:19,480
0,1050 1170,1860 1860,2070 2070,2550 2580,2850
Um, so, and then yeah

1939
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,740
0,180 180,630 630,840 840,930 930,1260
so there, this is again

1940
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:21,850
0,180 180,390 390,480 480,540 540,1110
going back to the confusion,

1941
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:24,190
0,60 60,270 270,840 1170,1740 1770,2340
the next question, I'm about

1942
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:26,050
0,240 240,1140 1140,1230 1230,1320 1320,1710
like synchronization, if the servers

1943
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:27,070
0,150 150,300 300,570 570,930 930,1020
are on different machines, so

1944
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:28,840
0,60 60,510 750,1350 1350,1500 1500,1770
the servers are on different

1945
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,270
0,540 570,990 990,1230 1230,1740 1740,2430
machines and they only communicate

1946
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:33,790
0,240 240,390 390,990 1080,1530 1530,2520
using our PCs, all synchronization

1947
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:35,920
0,210 210,450 450,1170 1170,1500 1500,2130
is just protecting or synchronizing

1948
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,480
0,90 90,450 450,600 600,960 960,1560
the threads on one server

1949
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,880
0,510 810,1110 1110,1260 1260,1350 1350,1800
I just want to emphasize

1950
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,640
0,300 390,630 630,750 750,1110
that one more time.

1951
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:44,660
0,540 540,870 870,1110 1110,1260 1260,1470
A common source of race

1952
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:47,450
0,780 780,1230 1380,1590 1590,2040 2070,2790
conditions, just you know blogging,

1953
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,540
0,810
um.

1954
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:50,560
0,420
Aye.

1955
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:51,930
0,180 180,360 360,570 570,720 720,1050
In some ways I think,

1956
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:54,180
0,660 780,1470 1470,1740 1740,1920 1920,2250
um someone's talking about like

1957
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:55,080
0,150 150,270 270,480 480,570 570,660
you know how do you

1958
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,130
0,120 120,390 390,510 510,930 930,1050
know when to lock and

1959
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:56,760
0,120 120,180 180,270 270,390 390,630
how do you know when

1960
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:00,780
0,510 780,1500 1500,2310 2550,3180 3180,4020
to use organization so anytime

1961
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,150
0,270 270,930 930,1020 1020,1800 2010,2370
you're modifying the state of

1962
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:05,070
0,780 900,1260 1260,1440 1440,1590 1590,1920
the feel like your ras

1963
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:07,200
0,330 330,480 480,570 570,1410 1650,2130
server or the coordinator anytime

1964
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,020
0,120 120,600 600,720 720,1290
you modify the state.

1965
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:11,000
0,120 120,360 360,540 540,990 1410,1980
You want to walk and

1966
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:12,740
0,240 240,480 480,960 960,1140 1140,1710
what you'll notice is that.

1967
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,850
0,480 480,870 870,1170 1170,1710 1710,1890
For almost every function in

1968
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:18,220
0,510 540,930 930,1620 1620,1710 1710,2370
your raft implementation, for example,

1969
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:20,260
0,420 420,600 600,1020 1020,1440 1470,2010
you will have a block

1970
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:21,550
0,120 120,450 480,690 690,1140 1140,1290
and then a differ a

1971
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:22,990
0,330 330,570 570,780 780,1140 1140,1440
lock, like right after that.

1972
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,950
0,330 330,630 630,1050 1290,1770 1770,2010
The only time you need

1973
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:26,730
0,90 90,300 300,510 510,630 630,780
to make sure that you're

1974
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:28,050
0,300 300,780 810,990 990,1200 1200,1320
not locked is when you

1975
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:28,800
0,150 150,240 240,510 510,600 600,750
make a call on my

1976
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,230
0,570 720,1740 1770,2160 2160,2250 2250,2430
block, so sending an R

1977
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:34,380
0,870 990,1890 2100,2640 2640,2850 2850,3150
C, um, you know sending

1978
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,690
0,330 330,570 570,1410 1710,2070 2070,2310
something over channel, those type

1979
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:38,160
0,90 90,780 780,900 900,1260 1260,1470
of operations you shouldn't walk

1980
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,780
0,240 240,570 570,750 750,1230 1320,1620
around because then you're you're

1981
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:40,710
0,270 270,480 480,570 570,810 810,930
that thread will just be

1982
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,150
0,390 390,480 480,750 870,1080 1080,1440
blocked on that and hold

1983
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:43,920
0,90 90,540 570,930 930,1650 1650,1770
the lock and stop the

1984
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,210
0,540 540,840 840,1110 1110,1200 1200,1290
server, any thread on the

1985
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:46,940
0,330 330,480 480,780 780,1380
server from making progress.

1986
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,310
0,690 750,1080 1080,1200 1200,1440 1440,1590
Um, yeah, and then there

1987
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:50,720
0,150 150,420 420,840 840,1080 1080,1410
are some questions about like.

1988
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:53,680
0,360 360,510 510,720 720,1800 1800,2010
There are some databases, they're

1989
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,060
0,480 480,690 690,780 780,1260 1260,1380
benign like for example you

1990
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:56,800
0,120 120,300 300,540 540,1080 1380,1740
could say is done to

1991
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,510
0,120 120,630 630,1140 1290,1410 1410,1710
be true and you know

1992
01:10:58,510 --> 01:10:59,530
0,330 330,420 420,630 630,840 840,1020
like you don't really need

1993
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:00,280
0,60 60,300 300,480 480,660 660,750
to lock around that, but

1994
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,810
0,90 90,330 330,720 720,840 840,1530
the race detector is complaining,

1995
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,820
0,750 960,1200 1200,1380 1380,1650 1650,1770
um, you could use an

1996
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:05,530
0,510 510,900 900,1320 1350,1620 1620,1710
atomic bull which has the

1997
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:07,300
0,240 240,690 690,930 930,1290 1290,1770
same behavior like walking before

1998
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,020
0,720 720,1260
unlocking after.

1999
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,350
0,600 990,1290 1290,1410 1410,1560 1560,1770
But even though you might

2000
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,910
0,180 180,330 330,570 570,900 900,1560
think this data raises benign

2001
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,940
0,480 570,1020 1020,1830 1950,2610 2640,2880
it's undefined behavior, so it

2002
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,320
0,240 240,450 450,1080 1080,1320 1320,1380
just so happens that you

2003
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,360
0,180 180,990 990,1110 1110,1440 1440,2040
know eventually the next read

2004
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:21,520
0,360 360,540 540,870 870,1290 1290,1860
like your read might Miss

2005
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:22,510
0,150 150,390 390,510 510,630 630,960
the fact that it's done

2006
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:23,230
0,150 150,210 210,450 450,600 600,720
but the next time you

2007
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:24,310
0,270 270,450 450,870 870,990 990,1080
call is done, it will

2008
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:25,570
0,360 360,750 750,870 870,1050 1050,1260
say true and then you're

2009
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:28,900
0,450 630,1680 1800,2280 2280,2880 2880,3330
fine but undefined behavior could

2010
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:31,660
0,930 990,1290 1290,1860 1860,2070 2070,2760
technically be implemented as anything

2011
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,130
0,300 300,420 420,780 780,990 990,1410
like it just so happens

2012
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:35,230
0,120 120,240 240,1080 1320,1860 1860,2100
that your compiler and your

2013
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:37,450
0,450 450,600 600,930 930,1680 1740,2220
processor does something reasonable when

2014
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:39,580
0,240 240,300 300,960 1080,1800 1950,2130
there's a database so you

2015
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:40,870
0,120 120,420 420,720 720,1080 1080,1290
should handle them especially when

2016
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:42,040
0,300 300,870
they're simple.

2017
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,360
0,510 510,720 720,810 810,1020 1020,1260
Um, and they don't really

2018
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,680
0,690 690,1230 1230,1380 1380,1800
affect performance that much.

2019
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,520
0,330 330,660 660,1110 1320,2040
Um, another thing is.

2020
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:49,880
0,480
Dog.

2021
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,400
0,600 810,1260 1260,1950 1950,2100 2100,2280
In in theory you could

2022
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,500
0,600 720,1170 1170,1410 1410,1680 1680,2100
have this like is sunday

2023
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,210
0,420 420,810 810,1260 1260,1500 1500,1710
race could potentially mean that

2024
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:58,490
0,570 690,1110 1110,1230 1230,1590 1590,2280
your process would never exit

2025
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:00,560
0,990 1110,1350 1350,1440 1440,1620 1620,2010
because you know the right

2026
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,970
0,270 270,510 510,990 990,1290 1290,1410
to is done setting it

2027
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:03,950
0,120 120,660 750,1320 1320,1530 1530,1980
to true man ever actually

2028
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:05,390
0,600 600,810 810,930 930,1170 1170,1440
propagate to the thread that's

2029
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:07,610
0,600 630,1170 1380,1800 1800,1950 1950,2220
reading what whether it's true

2030
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:08,720
0,120 120,420 420,900 900,990 990,1110
or not, because it could

2031
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,740
0,120 120,420 420,600 630,840 840,1020
be stored in some like

2032
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:11,810
0,570 630,810 810,1080 1080,1620 1650,2070
buffer and never flushed what

2033
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:13,700
0,360 360,510 510,1170 1320,1500 1500,1890
locks and sure is that

2034
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:14,780
0,210 210,720
you're right.

2035
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,310
0,540 540,750 750,1050 1050,1260 1260,1470
Um the next thread that

2036
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:19,700
0,600 990,1290 1290,1980 2400,2790 2790,3390
reads is done, we'll see

2037
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:22,730
0,270 270,870 1620,2220 2220,2520 2520,3030
the last write is done

2038
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:23,990
0,270 270,390 390,720 720,1050 1050,1230
and I'll actually flush it

2039
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:25,970
0,450 540,720 720,1350 1410,1590 1590,1980
from, for example a potential

2040
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:27,140
0,420 420,690 690,810 810,1020 1020,1170
buffer that the right could

2041
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,340
0,150 150,720
be started.

2042
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,980
0,570 870,1290 1290,1740 1740,1980 1980,2580
So yeah that's just emphasizing

2043
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,840
0,390 600,780 780,990 990,1140 1140,1860
like you don't want databases

2044
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:33,770
0,240 240,330 330,480 480,720 720,930
even if you think that

2045
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:35,500
0,210 210,450 450,960
they're really friendly.

2046
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:37,630
0,870 900,1170 1170,1290 1290,1410 1410,2040
I'm clean way to exit.

2047
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:41,140
0,990 1260,1980 1980,2460 2460,2730 2730,2910
So sending an exit a

2048
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:43,810
0,360 360,540 540,1050 1050,1740 1890,2640
VC firm coordination worker works

2049
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:45,960
0,360 360,660 660,1410
also like the.

2050
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:48,490
0,420 420,570 570,1080 1080,1620 1620,2310
Quote like messy exit where

2051
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:50,290
0,150 150,870 900,1320 1320,1410 1410,1680
the worker tries to send

2052
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:51,790
0,180 180,810 810,960 990,1380 1380,1500
our CMC, the socket is

2053
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:53,350
0,450 480,870 870,1140 1140,1290 1290,1560
closed like those are also

2054
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:54,720
0,840
fine.

2055
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,900
0,600
WE.

2056
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,930
0,300 300,900 1050,1740 1740,2220 2400,2850
Like most solutions are equally

2057
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:01,260
0,720 1140,1770
acceptable, um.

2058
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,400
0,180 180,480 480,690 720,1350 1350,1620
And then I expected and

2059
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,820
0,360 360,900 900,1860
file earth so.

2060
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:06,900
0,150 150,420 420,690 690,900 900,1080
You can look I have

2061
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,310
0,330 330,600 600,840 840,1050 1050,1410
a link here that it

2062
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:09,510
0,330 330,540 540,720 720,1110 1110,1200
shows when it's invoked the

2063
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,220
0,480 480,690 690,840 840,930 930,1710
client but it's a little

2064
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:14,010
0,960 960,1110 1110,1230 1230,1410 1410,1620
confusing as to when that

2065
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:15,300
0,270 270,630 630,780 780,930 930,1290
actually happens, so I would.

2066
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:16,860
0,300 300,510 510,720 720,840 840,960
Not worry about it too

2067
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,120
0,450 510,690 690,870 870,990 990,1260
much, if any one has

2068
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,880
0,480 480,1110
inside instead.

2069
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:23,260
0,690 1230,1380 1380,1500 1500,1710 1710,1920
Um, if they got this

2070
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:24,940
0,420 420,540 540,660 660,1140 1170,1680
air at a very strange

2071
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,260
0,450 450,870 900,1020 1020,1170 1170,1320
moment, then we could look

2072
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:27,490
0,210 210,510 600,960 960,1080 1080,1230
into it, but I think

2073
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:28,840
0,240 240,570 570,990 990,1140 1140,1350
it's very specific on your

2074
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,680
0,450 450,570 570,600 600,690 690,840
meditation, so I would have

2075
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:30,640
0,90 90,240 240,330 330,660 780,960
to look at that, in

2076
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,230
0,720 1020,1200 1200,1290 1290,1530 1530,1590
particular, but we got a

2077
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:35,830
0,180 180,270 270,630 630,1080 2580,3600
bunch of questions about yeah

2078
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:37,990
0,180 180,450 450,600 600,1020 1020,2160
I think so that's basically

2079
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,220
0,480 480,540 540,630 630,1020 1020,1140
most of the questions that

2080
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:40,810
0,210 210,480 480,930 1230,1380 1380,1590
came up and I think

2081
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:41,740
0,360 360,570 570,660 660,780 780,930
now if you have any

2082
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:44,020
0,480 480,870 870,960 960,1410 1440,2280
questions about you know go

2083
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:45,970
0,360 390,1080 1080,1530 1560,1680 1680,1800
map reduce or if you

2084
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:47,320
0,150 150,480 600,930 930,1110 1110,1350
want to ask staff about

2085
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,660
0,360 420,1080
the labs.

2086
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,220
0,120 120,210 210,270 270,780 780,1290
I had a question about

2087
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:52,410
0,540 600,1230 1320,1830 1830,2070 2070,2190
um, the clean way to

2088
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:53,640
0,630
exit.

2089
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:55,940
0,510 960,1560 1560,1680 1680,1890 1890,2070
Right, so you're saying like

2090
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:58,460
0,450 480,1230 1230,2130 2220,2430 2430,2520
something xc RBC I was

2091
01:13:58,460 --> 01:13:59,390
0,150 150,450 450,600 600,780 780,930
just wondering if there were

2092
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:00,530
0,240 240,450 450,600 600,780 780,1140
like if there was like

2093
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:03,680
0,360 360,1140 1380,1710 1710,2070 2070,3030
a case where a worker

2094
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:05,060
0,300 300,600 600,930 930,1110 1110,1320
for some reason just takes

2095
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:07,400
0,900 900,1170 1170,1440 1440,1950 1980,2340
a very long time to

2096
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,750
0,270 270,390 390,960 960,1200 1200,1350
reach the server right, like

2097
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:09,500
0,180 180,390 390,510 510,660 660,750
how like how does the

2098
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,140
0,360 360,1170
server know.

2099
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:13,750
0,390 390,1020 1020,1230 1230,1800 2160,2580
Like when to like shut

2100
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:16,540
0,420 660,1110 1110,1830 2070,2370 2370,2790
down because, because because the

2101
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,980
0,630 630,960 960,1170 1170,1260 1260,1440
coordinator shuts down at some

2102
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:19,300
0,240 240,390 390,510 510,840 870,1320
point I think when when

2103
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:20,830
0,240 240,360 360,690 690,1050 1080,1500
when it says like done

2104
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:22,880
0,270 270,600 600,990 990,1560
when done returns true.

2105
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:24,980
0,720 960,1140 1140,1410 1410,1830 1830,2010
Um, it shuts down and

2106
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,810
0,270 270,420 420,810 810,1620 1620,1830
so it stops replying to

2107
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:28,220
0,150 150,900
the workers.

2108
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:29,600
0,360 360,510 510,660 660,780 780,1320
Um, how does it decide

2109
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,830
0,450 450,570 570,810 810,1080 1080,1230
when to do that if

2110
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:32,620
0,150 150,750 750,1320
it's waiting for.

2111
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:35,620
0,270 270,1170 1530,2250 2370,2790 2790,3000
For workers to shut down

2112
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:36,960
0,810
themselves.

2113
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:39,310
0,600 600,870 870,1110 1110,1320 1320,1740
Oh, so in this case

2114
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:42,420
0,330 360,1350 1590,2520
the coordinator isn't.

2115
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:43,920
0,300 300,480 480,840 840,1110 1110,1380
Oh I guess, so sun

2116
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,330
0,300 420,690 690,780 780,990 990,1410
is probably the wrong word,

2117
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,710
0,120 120,630 630,900 900,1230 1230,1350
the coordinator isn't waiting for

2118
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:48,420
0,90 90,450 450,540 540,1110 1260,1710
the workers to respond, the

2119
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:50,910
0,630 630,1140 1500,1980 1980,2310 2310,2460
coordinator is not sending it's

2120
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:53,460
0,720 720,900 900,1440 1770,2340 2340,2550
replying to the request from

2121
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,440
0,510 510,780 780,1320 1590,1890 1890,1980
workers with a like the

2122
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,120
0,360 360,570 570,840 840,1140 1140,1680
task is done, please exit

2123
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:59,160
0,210 210,570 570,1110 1260,1530 1530,1740
the worker isn't a the

2124
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,810
0,540 540,780 780,1050 1050,1320 1320,1650
coordinator isn't actually worth waiting

2125
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:01,740
0,120 120,240 240,540 540,630 630,930
for the workers at all,

2126
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:02,790
0,360 360,510 510,600 600,750 750,1020
and so in this case

2127
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:05,100
0,90 90,720 720,900 900,1560 1560,2310
the coordinator could actually still

2128
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:06,900
0,390 390,630 630,750 750,1290 1350,1770
exit before the workers and

2129
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,700
0,270 270,360 360,840 840,1350 1380,1800
caused the workers to like.

2130
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,970
0,510 750,1320 1320,1650 1650,2340 2340,2670
You have a disconnected socket

2131
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:13,780
0,480 480,660 660,1200
error and exit.

2132
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:15,600
0,450 450,870 870,870 870,1350 1350,1470
Yeah I I guess that

2133
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,680
0,120 120,240 240,600 600,750 750,1080
was my question very like

2134
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,630
0,270 270,630 660,1320 1410,1650 1650,1770
like if if it I

2135
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:19,980
0,180 180,900
could though.

2136
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:23,130
0,780 780,1560 1830,2010 2010,2670 2670,3090
Coordinators replying to workers right

2137
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:25,260
0,180 180,540 570,810 810,1320 1320,2130
that are like potentially like

2138
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:27,990
0,480 480,1140 1350,1770 1770,2070 2070,2700
asking for a get task,

2139
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,600
0,510 510,780 780,1290 1290,1980 2010,2280
but what happens if the

2140
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,940
0,420 420,810 810,1470 1710,1890 1890,2340
worker shuts down or sorry

2141
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:34,920
0,120 120,720 720,1020 1020,1260 1260,1980
the coordinator shuts down before

2142
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:37,410
0,270 270,510 510,900 900,900 900,2340
it gets A I get

2143
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,240
0,120 120,330 330,780 780,1200 1200,1800
I get task bc from

2144
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,420
0,150 150,750
the worker.

2145
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:41,890
0,240 240,420 420,510 510,750 750,990
Oh, then the next time

2146
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:43,390
0,270 270,660 660,960 960,1110 1110,1500
the worker tries to contact

2147
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:44,680
0,60 60,600 600,750 750,1110 1110,1290
the coordinator the worker will

2148
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,700
0,270 270,450 450,540 540,900 900,1020
see that the connection is

2149
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:48,220
0,390 390,480 480,660 660,1140
closed and then exit.

2150
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:51,400
0,510 660,1080 1080,1290 1290,2070 2250,3060
Yeah that's as clean a

2151
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,460
0,540 540,720 720,900 900,1380
shutdown as we'll get.

2152
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:55,420
0,420
AH.

2153
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:57,770
0,1080 1080,1170 1170,1350 1350,1470 1470,1710
Essentially, I mean you could

2154
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:59,420
0,540 540,960
imagine that.

2155
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,320
0,150 150,300 300,480 480,630 630,840
You know you could set

2156
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,940
0,180 180,420 420,900 900,1020 1020,1620
up the workers to be

2157
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:03,620
0,450 450,990 990,1170 1170,1230 1230,1350
RBC servers, then you would

2158
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:04,850
0,390 390,570 570,630 630,1110 1110,1230
actually have the coordinator be

2159
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:07,460
0,690 990,1140 1140,1560 1560,1980 2220,2610
sending to use like please

2160
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:08,510
0,360 360,450 450,750 750,930 930,1050
exit the corner you'll have

2161
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:09,410
0,120 120,360 360,450 450,570 570,900
to wait for the workers

2162
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:11,000
0,90 90,510 660,870 870,1050 1050,1590
to exit but it's not.

2163
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,340
0,720
I'm.

2164
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:16,480
0,330 330,540 540,810 810,990 990,1140
Um, it doesn't seem like

2165
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,740
0,90 90,240 240,390 390,750 750,1260
you won't get any utility

2166
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,620
0,510
outlet.

2167
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:22,720
0,540 810,2010
Thanks yeah.

2168
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,190
0,570 600,930 930,1050 1050,1230 1230,1440
A cat I see you

2169
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:26,120
0,180 180,630 870,1440
have your hands.

2170
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,160
0,1020 1050,1380 1380,1590 1590,1710 1710,1920
Yeah something that I was

2171
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,810
0,450 450,900 900,1260 1260,1440 1440,1650
wondering about is for the

2172
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,040
0,420 420,750 750,870 870,960 960,1200
future labs are we allowed

2173
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,510
0,90 90,270 270,510 510,1110 1110,1470
to have more files possessing

2174
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:33,800
0,600 600,690 690,750 750,990 990,1290
explicitly in the map, reduce

2175
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,580
0,240 240,300 300,390 390,600 600,780
lab, we were only supposed

2176
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,020
0,60 60,210 210,660
to have three.

2177
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,770
0,480 510,990 990,1380 1410,1710 1710,2070
And it didn't read something

2178
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:39,970
0,120 120,180 180,360 360,750 810,1200
where it was like hey

2179
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:40,540
0,120 120,240 240,360 360,480 480,570
you should have all of

2180
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:42,400
0,150 150,540 930,1410 1410,1500 1500,1860
your stuff contained in one.

2181
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:44,830
0,270 270,570 570,960 960,1140 1140,1290
Oh yeah, so you can

2182
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:48,220
0,630 630,930 930,1110 1110,1680 2610,3390
definitely add more files, that's

2183
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:50,320
0,600 750,900 900,1110 1110,1560 1560,2070
like I would almost encourage

2184
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,240
0,960
that.

2185
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,560
0,510 510,660 660,780 780,930 930,1320
Hey do we say about

2186
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,900
0,750
averages.

2187
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:56,210
0,210 210,210 210,690 690,810 810,1050
I I don't I can't

2188
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:58,970
0,420 420,690 690,2100 2130,2400 2430,2760
remember whether we couldn't edit

2189
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:00,110
0,210 210,300 300,420 420,690 690,1140
any of the other main

2190
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:02,660
0,630 630,840 840,1020 1020,1260 1260,2550
files it like yeah yeah

2191
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:05,360
0,1170 1170,1740 1770,1890 1890,2340 2340,2610
yeah, okay I misread that

2192
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,650
0,300 300,450 450,630 630,900 1080,1290
thanks, this makes me feel

2193
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:09,290
0,120 120,360 360,720 960,1590 1590,2640
a lot better, yeah yeah.

2194
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:11,550
0,300 300,870 870,1200 1200,1500 1500,1770
But definitely like bring your

2195
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:14,160
0,330 330,600 600,1170 1200,1830 2010,2610
code will be useful, um.

2196
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,590
0,270 270,390 390,570 600,1050 1050,1290
I have a question about

2197
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:19,690
0,450 480,780 780,990 990,1590 1590,2100
the benign data races on.

2198
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,420
0,150 150,390 390,750
I guess like.

2199
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:24,220
0,300 300,780 780,1170 1170,1260 1260,1590
Cause sometimes there's for example

2200
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,180
0,330 330,450 450,630 630,750 750,960
raft, you just want to

2201
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:27,040
0,300 300,480 480,780 780,1260 1380,1830
read the current state of

2202
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,500
0,480 660,1050 1050,1380 1410,1770 1770,2460
the of the raft server,

2203
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:32,350
0,600 720,1140 1140,1560 1830,2400 2400,2760
um, why would multiple write

2204
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:33,910
0,450 450,720 720,1050 1050,1230 1230,1530
multiple threads writing to it

2205
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,890
0,180 180,390 390,810 840,1380 1560,1770
and when reading so why

2206
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:37,210
0,150 150,300 300,690 690,1200 1200,1320
would a reader right to

2207
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:38,830
0,90 90,420 420,1140 1170,1350 1350,1620
the same variable and up.

2208
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,290
0,330 330,840 840,1260 1260,1470 1470,1770
Cause undefined behavior because it

2209
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,520
0,240 240,510 510,870 870,960 960,1230
either comes before or after

2210
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,660
0,120 120,570
the right.

2211
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:45,300
0,690
SO.

2212
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:47,700
0,360 360,660 660,1080 1110,1560 1560,2370
One thing that can happen

2213
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,130
0,840 870,1290 1290,1980 1980,2250 2250,2430
and most processors don't do

2214
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:52,060
0,510 540,1380
this but.

2215
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:55,120
0,390 390,780 780,1050 1050,1590 1590,2460
Every time you have a.

2216
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,850
0,300 300,480 480,900 990,1290 1290,1710
Like so these any thread

2217
01:17:57,850 --> 01:17:59,680
0,240 240,450 450,630 630,1410 1410,1830
can run on a separate

2218
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,700
0,420
core.

2219
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:03,490
0,600 720,1380 1740,2070 2070,2340 2340,2790
Um, and every core has

2220
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:06,340
0,720 750,1590 1740,2340 2340,2460 2460,2850
a buffer for the data

2221
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:07,840
0,240 240,480 480,870 870,990 990,1500
that it's reading or writing

2222
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:09,490
0,210 210,540 540,690 690,900 900,1020
or writing I guess like

2223
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:11,020
0,90 90,330 330,810 870,1350 1350,1530
a store buffer, so for

2224
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,420
0,810 810,1140 1140,1560 1560,1830 1830,2400
example thread one could write.

2225
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:16,920
0,270 270,900 900,1440 1440,1680 1680,2340
One value to the state

2226
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,870
0,330 330,570 570,960 960,1380 1380,1590
and read two could try

2227
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:20,310
0,150 150,360 360,630 810,1200 1200,1440
to read it, um, or

2228
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:21,240
0,150 150,480 480,720 720,840 840,930
like multiple threads can be

2229
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:24,540
0,510 1050,1710 1800,2220 2220,2700 2700,3300
writing and thread, one without

2230
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,820
0,180 180,570 570,780 780,1410 1500,2280
a lock, so locks essentially

2231
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:30,270
0,450 450,600 600,1170 2550,3120 3120,3450
flush the buffer without that

2232
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:31,340
0,600
lock.

2233
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,230
0,360 360,750 750,1020 1020,1440 1590,1890
This right might just like

2234
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:35,420
0,270 270,540 540,810 810,1620 1680,2190
stay in red ones like

2235
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:38,210
0,510 510,1140 1620,2190 2250,2490 2490,2790
for forever and the read

2236
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:41,000
0,270 270,840 840,1530 1890,2580 2610,2790
will never return, I'm the

2237
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,330
0,420 420,990 1320,2160 2190,2460 2460,3330
updated value, so this behavior.

2238
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:46,990
0,600 600,990 990,1320 1320,1440 1440,1890
Doesn't quite happen in practice

2239
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:48,850
0,150 150,360 360,600 600,1200 1200,1860
but it's an allowable behavior

2240
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:49,810
0,390 390,480 480,570 570,750 750,930
because you do not have

2241
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:50,800
0,60 60,420
a lot.

2242
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,440
0,390 390,540 540,720 720,1050 1050,1200
Sorry so what happens if

2243
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:53,460
0,150 150,390 390,600 600,660 660,1020
the right has a lock,

2244
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:55,260
0,120 120,300 300,570 570,1260
but the reed doesn't.

2245
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:57,030
0,240 240,420 420,750 780,1140 1140,1650
Like does the read always

2246
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:58,520
0,270 270,450 450,930
need a lock.

2247
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:05,360
0,1830
Yes.

2248
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,220
0,1170
Because.

2249
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,860
0,630 630,840
Singular ie.

2250
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:15,140
0,240 240,240 240,870 870,990 990,1170
I I googled a little

2251
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:16,160
0,210 210,360 360,630 630,750 750,1020
bit and people are like

2252
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,720
0,330 330,660 660,870 870,1080 1080,1560
yeah don't don't even try

2253
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:20,060
0,390 390,1020 1320,1680 1680,1980 1980,2130
lock less shared data, but

2254
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:21,440
0,60 60,330 330,630 630,1080 1080,1380
I don't really understand why

2255
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,550
0,180 180,330 330,450 450,540 540,1110
that would be a problem.

2256
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:25,120
0,420 420,510 510,780 780,1290
So I could lie.

2257
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:26,620
0,570
Good.

2258
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:28,100
0,150 150,330 330,600 600,750 750,960
You could like be doing

2259
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,300
0,330 330,510 510,930 930,1050 1050,1200
something that assumes the thing

2260
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,440
0,180 180,600 600,720 720,960 960,1140
was true, and then like

2261
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,790
0,120 120,270 270,690 720,1110 1110,1350
when you read it's not

2262
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:33,410
0,330 330,600 600,990 1170,1470 1470,1620
actually true, yet like there

2263
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:34,850
0,240 240,360 360,780 780,1080 1080,1440
might be multiple things right.

2264
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:37,490
0,180 180,420 420,510 510,720 720,870
That's why you don't want

2265
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:39,060
0,90 90,360 360,660 660,1020
to lock this read.

2266
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:41,800
0,420 450,990 1110,1590 1590,2040 2040,2460
So the only time you

2267
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,930
0,660 1020,1350 1350,1620 1620,1800 1800,2130
might be able to even

2268
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:45,580
0,240 240,540 540,750 750,1290 1320,1650
get away with this is

2269
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:47,140
0,300 300,660 720,1260 1260,1470 1470,1560
if you only read a

2270
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:49,990
0,660 660,1200 1470,2040 2130,2490 2490,2850
single word and that's all

2271
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:50,980
0,150 150,420 420,720 720,840 840,990
the thread does and it

2272
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:53,340
0,450 450,690 690,1290 1290,1890
never does multiple reads.

2273
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:55,430
0,180 180,300 300,540 540,840 870,1380
But I think you still

2274
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:58,600
0,240 240,1020 1380,2070 2070,2730
have some issues with.

2275
01:20:01,150 --> 01:20:02,860
0,270 270,330 330,750 780,1230 1230,1710
One of the other things

2276
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:05,230
0,750 1440,1680 1680,1830 1830,2100 2100,2370
is if you're reading more

2277
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:06,400
0,120 120,330 330,600 600,690 690,1170
than one piece of data

2278
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:07,720
0,270 270,390 390,480 480,750 750,1230
like if on one thread,

2279
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,670
0,450 480,780 780,1170 1170,1620 1620,1950
you take lock, assign a

2280
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:12,610
0,450 450,900 1020,1710 1710,2400 2640,2940
assign b another thread, it

2281
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:14,290
0,330 330,510 510,600 600,1200 1230,1680
doesn't take a lock might

2282
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:16,570
0,600 630,1290 1350,1890 1890,1980 1980,2280
see be the new value

2283
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:17,590
0,120 120,360 360,690 690,780 780,1020
of b before it sees

2284
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:18,610
0,60 60,180 180,540 540,660 660,1020
the new value of a

2285
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:19,960
0,300 300,690 690,780 780,900 900,1170
the ordering that you messed

2286
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:20,650
0,150 150,360 360,450 450,540 540,690
up and so if you

2287
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:23,590
0,210 210,510 810,1020 1020,1890 2700,2940
read like a term from

2288
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:25,750
0,420 420,810 990,1320 1320,1530 1530,2160
one that from one variable

2289
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,880
0,420 750,1200 1350,1740 1740,2010 2010,2130
and like whether nods the

2290
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,620
0,270 270,390 390,660 660,1260 1560,1740
leader for another variable you

2291
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:31,210
0,330 360,810 810,1080 1110,1500 1500,1590
might read a pair of

2292
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:33,370
0,510 510,690 690,1020 1020,1410 1410,2160
values that never actually existed

2293
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:34,760
0,720
because.

2294
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:36,780
0,240 240,450 450,450 450,900 900,1710
The arts are art guarantees

2295
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:38,130
0,630 660,870 870,960 960,1230 1230,1320
like when you're wishing to

2296
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:40,740
0,450 450,1170 1380,2130 2160,2490 2490,2610
concrete systems, you need to

2297
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:42,330
0,480 480,870 870,1140 1140,1350 1350,1590
build everything based off what

2298
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:43,890
0,60 60,630 630,930 930,1050 1050,1560
the guarantees are the platform

2299
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:45,360
0,600 600,810 810,1200 1200,1290 1290,1470
provides you and if you

2300
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,010
0,300 300,870 870,1200 1200,1560 1560,1650
don't there's all kinds of

2301
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:48,780
0,540 540,780 780,1200 1200,1350 1350,1770
weird edge cases that can

2302
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,360
0,330 330,480 480,930 1140,2070
throw you off and.

2303
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,640
0,660
Yeah.

2304
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,540
0,300 300,420 420,600 600,810 810,900
Yes, so I think the

2305
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:54,950
0,330 330,780 780,930 930,1260 1260,1410
only case in which you

2306
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:56,960
0,150 150,690 1020,1410 1410,1800 1800,2010
can even like try to

2307
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,580
0,300 300,630 630,960 990,1260 1260,1620
reason about this is this

2308
01:20:58,730 --> 01:20:59,930
0,150 150,390 390,690 690,960 960,1200
is this there's only ever

2309
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:02,450
0,450 450,750 900,1080 1080,1530 1680,2520
one like you, no word

2310
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:03,680
0,180 180,270 270,750 750,870 870,1230
in the system that you're

2311
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:04,730
0,270 270,600 600,750 750,930 930,1050
ever trying to read and

2312
01:21:04,730 --> 01:21:06,320
0,240 240,540 630,1110 1110,1440 1440,1590
write to as soon as

2313
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,000
0,120 120,600 600,1200
you try to.

2314
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:11,270
0,480 480,660 660,930 930,2160 2460,3210
Write or read multiple pieces

2315
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:13,280
0,120 120,390 390,990 990,1320 1650,2010
of data, then it's like

2316
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:14,240
0,180 180,420 420,480 480,780 780,930
you won't be able to

2317
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,040
0,210 210,480 480,930 930,1260 1260,1800
reason about anything without locks.

2318
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,310
0,930 930,1050 1050,1170 1170,1440 1440,1830
Basically, if you want to

2319
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,630
0,300 300,570 570,660 660,930 930,1110
play games with us, you

2320
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:22,610
0,300 300,690 780,1290 1290,1890 1890,1980
have to really understand the

2321
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:24,680
0,930 930,1110 1110,1410 1440,1770 1770,2070
compiler, the whole putting language

2322
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,720
0,150 150,510 510,1110 1170,1380 1380,2040
and memory model, the processor

2323
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,550
0,150 150,750 750,990 1200,1590 1590,1830
you're using and it's like

2324
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:31,940
0,420 420,990 990,1620 2550,2910 2910,3360
memory coherency system, it gets

2325
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:34,580
0,540 540,1170 1170,1770 1770,2190
awfully complicated incredibly quickly.

2326
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:35,880
0,270 270,420 420,630 630,990 990,1080
Yeah it's also like I

2327
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:36,990
0,270 270,420 420,540 540,840 840,1110
mean this is all a

2328
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:38,160
0,240 240,630 630,840 840,1110 1110,1170
fan behavior, so even if

2329
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,990
0,120 120,360 360,870 1110,1590 1710,1830
it works now like you

2330
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:41,370
0,180 180,330 330,750 810,1140 1140,1380
know I could, someone could

2331
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:42,810
0,180 180,510 510,630 630,1320 1320,1440
write a new compiler and

2332
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:45,210
0,390 420,1380 1680,1920 1920,2130 2130,2400
then you're like that's where

2333
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:46,710
0,90 90,840 840,990 990,1200 1200,1500
the whole thing about like

2334
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:47,850
0,480 480,660 660,900 900,990 990,1140
demons can fly on your

2335
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:49,890
0,510 510,870 1140,1290 1290,1620 1620,2040
nose like it can literally

2336
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:50,820
0,180 180,660 660,750 750,840 840,930
do anything if you have

2337
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:51,870
0,60 60,300 300,540 540,900 900,1050
a data it's because like

2338
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:53,320
0,270 270,750 750,990
other programs like.

2339
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,850
0,450 480,720 720,870 870,1380 1380,1530
Doesn't have any semantic so

2340
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:57,160
0,120 120,570 780,1110 1290,1710 1710,2310
we can like go crazy,

2341
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,930
0,330 330,510 510,900 1080,1230 1230,1350
so I would I would

2342
01:21:58,930 --> 01:22:00,640
0,330 330,570 570,1140
not risk it.

2343
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:02,940
0,210 210,270 270,480 480,870 870,1080
Okay, it makes sense, thank

2344
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:03,880
0,300
you.

2345
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:05,560
0,450 450,690 690,930 930,1140 1140,1290
So, so even when we're

2346
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,630
0,570 570,1050 1080,1530 1530,1710 1710,2070
accessing language anything, just reading

2347
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:09,310
0,390 390,570 570,840 840,1110 1110,1680
let's say raf cyber state,

2348
01:22:09,370 --> 01:22:10,570
0,150 150,300 300,750 750,1020 1020,1200
we should still wrap it

2349
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:12,060
0,330 360,510 510,960
in a lock.

2350
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,960
0,900 900,990 990,1140 1140,1350 1350,1680
Yeah it just gets annoying

2351
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,040
0,600 600,810 810,870 870,960 960,1080
sometimes because you have to

2352
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,000
0,420
like.

2353
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:18,370
0,960 960,1050 1050,1470 1470,1770 1770,2250
Wrap the single reed in

2354
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:19,930
0,180 180,450 450,540 540,1110 1110,1470
a lock and unlock but

2355
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,540
0,150 150,330 330,690
I'm not sure.

2356
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,480
0,360 360,690 690,1110
Mike knows anything.

2357
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:27,300
0,810 870,1170 1170,1440 1440,1890 1890,2760
Um that shouldn't happen super

2358
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,580
0,660
often.

2359
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,290
0,330 330,420 420,960 990,1500 1500,1650
Like I mean maybe if

2360
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:32,190
0,120 120,300 300,420 420,540 540,900
you want to, for example

2361
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:33,690
0,240 240,420 420,690 690,1260 1290,1500
check your sole leader, if

2362
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:34,860
0,150 150,450 450,750 750,870 870,1170
you're not eggs or something

2363
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:37,020
0,150 150,450 1020,1620
like that, but.

2364
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,570
0,630 630,780 780,1200 1260,1680 1680,2070
Yeah I don't like I

2365
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:43,680
0,420 420,510 510,570 570,930 930,1110
forget do you use like

2366
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:46,140
0,450 450,840 840,1470 1800,2100 2100,2460
atomic bulls for like killed

2367
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,900
0,540 540,630 630,1260
state for example.

2368
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,820
0,420 480,930 930,1050 1050,1200 1200,1380
But like you could use

2369
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,440
0,90 90,750 750,1020 1020,1470 1470,1620
a typo which essentially is

2370
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,060
0,300 330,750 750,870 870,1410 1410,1620
like locking and unlocking right

2371
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:55,440
0,480 570,840 840,930 930,1110 1110,1380
before nice to see it.

2372
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:57,400
0,120 120,270 270,810
And right after.

2373
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,500
0,540
But.

2374
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,260
0,660
Yeah.

2375
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:07,200
0,660 1530,2010 2010,2580 2610,2880 2880,3300
I think you'll like having

2376
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,490
0,120 120,270 270,570 570,990 990,1290
in some ways very coarse

2377
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:10,200
0,210 210,600 600,840 840,1350 1350,1710
grain locks and knowing that

2378
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:11,580
0,450 450,540 540,750 750,900 900,1230
you're the only one touching

2379
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:12,420
0,90 90,270 270,360 360,690 690,840
a piece of state will

2380
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:13,500
0,600
become.

2381
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,150
0,450 450,1020 1020,1230 1230,1350 1350,1650
Very handy as you reason

2382
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:17,540
0,360 360,750 780,1380
about your patients.

2383
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,300
0,330 330,630
Thank you.

2384
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:22,950
0,420 420,510 510,600 600,690 690,1020
A I have a question

2385
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:25,890
0,570 870,1260 1260,1830 1830,2490 2670,2940
about the channels, so when

2386
01:23:25,890 --> 01:23:27,240
0,330 330,600 600,690 690,1200 1200,1350
you make a channel it's

2387
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:30,120
0,240 240,870 1020,1440 1440,2370 2400,2880
only between two threads, right,

2388
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,140
0,270 270,360 360,600 600,720 720,1020
or it can be between

2389
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,120
0,390 390,750 750,930 930,1590 1620,1980
multiple threads, but like if

2390
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,010
0,540 600,1320 1320,1410 1410,1620 1620,1890
you not if you don't

2391
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,280
0,1170 1470,2190 2340,2490 2490,2760 2760,3270
have buffered, it can potentially

2392
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,540
0,240 240,510 510,600 600,870 870,1260
just lock and block forever

2393
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:41,310
0,330 330,780 930,1290 1290,1650 1650,1770
right, so, for example if

2394
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:42,240
0,180 180,330 330,390 390,540 540,930
you want to do something

2395
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,560
0,450 450,570 570,900 930,1110 1110,1320
raf and then you have

2396
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,920
0,150 150,870
an election.

2397
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:45,880
0,120 120,210 210,300 300,630 630,870
You have a channel that

2398
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,840
0,390
like.

2399
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,310
0,300 300,570 570,840 840,1230 1230,1470
Does something about election time

2400
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,300
0,420 420,570 570,660 660,870 870,990
outs, you will need a

2401
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,250
0,300 300,930 1230,1680 1680,1860 1860,1950
buffer channel, that's like the

2402
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:52,300
0,360 360,600 630,750 750,990 990,1050
size of the amount of

2403
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,130
0,540 540,930 930,1350 1350,1530 1530,1830
servers correct because you could

2404
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,840
0,450 660,990 990,1380 1380,1530 1530,1710
like send something and then

2405
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,100
0,210 210,360 360,1020 1020,1830
like it blocks because.

2406
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,110
0,180 180,270 270,570 570,720 720,810
You can be, you can

2407
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:01,510
0,240 240,750 750,1110 1140,2010 2010,2400
have multiple like election, um

2408
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,270
0,600 630,1380 1380,1950 1950,2250 2250,2670
things election messages sent between

2409
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:05,680
0,180 180,900
the channels.

2410
01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:07,040
0,390 390,630 630,810 810,900 900,1110
Correct, so if you want

2411
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,270
0,330 330,690 690,990 990,1050 1050,1230
a buffered channel, it should

2412
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:09,830
0,150 150,210 210,720 1230,1380 1380,1560
only be between it should

2413
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:11,120
0,180 180,360 360,720 720,870 870,1290
only be between two threads

2414
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,060
0,450 810,1410
only correct.

2415
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:15,100
0,510 540,840 840,1050 1050,1530 1530,1680
I mean not necessarily like

2416
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,420
0,150 150,300 300,570 570,690 690,1320
if two threads are consumers

2417
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:17,440
0,120 120,300 300,570 570,630 630,1020
and when threads are produced

2418
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,080
0,180 180,300 300,600
at the back.

2419
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:22,050
0,480 480,840 840,1200 1200,1860 1860,1980
Okay, but multiple producers I

2420
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:23,550
0,300 300,570 570,690 690,1020 1110,1500
guess you would need that

2421
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:24,720
0,600
correct.

2422
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:27,440
0,570 600,960 960,1380 1380,1500 1500,1650
Well, not necessarily, I mean

2423
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,510
0,90 90,180 180,1230 1230,1770 1920,2070
if the consumer is you

2424
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:30,230
0,120 120,270 270,420 420,480 480,720
know just doing a loop

2425
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:32,570
0,270 270,810 810,1170 1170,1680 2130,2340
and constantly reading then all

2426
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:35,260
0,420 540,1560 1590,1800 1800,2250
the producers would just.

2427
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:36,760
0,360
Yeah.

2428
01:24:37,490 --> 01:24:38,390
0,180 180,330 330,450 450,810 810,900
I guess it depends on

2429
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:40,430
0,120 120,240 240,960 1380,1800 1800,2040
how they schedule a by

2430
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:41,640
0,660
it.

2431
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,080
0,180 180,360 360,450 450,540 540,1440
You're like you would eventually

2432
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,670
0,480 570,900 900,1200 1200,1380 1380,1590
have someone reading from the

2433
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,440
0,600 1050,1230 1230,1350 1350,1590 1590,1740
channel so you can have

2434
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:48,660
0,300 300,810 810,990 990,1500 1500,2220
multiple producers and one consumer.

2435
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,270
0,300 300,510 510,810 810,930 930,1230
Actually, does anyone know about

2436
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:54,760
0,510 540,1020 1020,1530 2280,2400 2400,2490
the micron saw do you

2437
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,930
0,90 90,300 300,420 420,750 750,1170
know about the ordering guarantees

2438
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:57,310
0,90 90,750 780,1050 1050,1230 1230,1380
of channels like eyes, their

2439
01:24:57,310 --> 01:24:59,740
0,510 510,1050 1050,1290 1290,1920
aliveness guarantee or you.

2440
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:03,460
0,180 180,330 330,480 480,690 690,840
I feel like there is

2441
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:04,630
0,90 90,570 570,960 960,1080 1080,1170
an aliveness guarantee, so I

2442
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:06,220
0,210 210,360 360,510 510,990
guess if you have.

2443
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,180
0,420 420,600 600,750 750,810 810,960
Um, it's kind of like

2444
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:08,800
0,480 480,870 1050,1290 1290,1440 1440,1620
logs right like if you're

2445
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,850
0,330 330,570 570,660 660,960 960,1050
always trying to acquire the

2446
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:11,530
0,300 300,630 630,870 870,1080 1380,1680
logs, another thread is also

2447
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:12,820
0,450 450,750 750,960 960,1020 1020,1290
spending and trying to acquire

2448
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:15,460
0,90 90,450 480,780 780,1320 1440,2640
the lock, there's no guarantee

2449
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:17,110
0,390 390,570 570,750 750,1020 1020,1620
that you will ever require

2450
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:17,950
0,180 240,480 480,600 600,810 810,840
it, which is why I

2451
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:18,820
0,360
like.

2452
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:20,440
0,780 780,960 960,1050 1050,1530 1530,1590
Randomization might be necessary in

2453
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,560
0,150 150,600
that case.

2454
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,390
0,300 300,420 420,930 930,1080 1080,1350
Also I realized I think

2455
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:29,610
0,330 330,480 480,990 990,1500 1770,2220
mature is technically over A

2456
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:30,810
0,210 210,360 360,630 630,750 750,1110
I am holding the office

2457
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:32,220
0,360 360,510 510,840 840,1230 1230,1410
hours right now, so if

2458
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:33,450
0,150 150,300 300,630 630,960 960,1230
you have questions along to

2459
01:25:33,450 --> 01:25:34,590
0,210 210,390 390,450 450,870 870,1140
or want to continue asking

2460
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:36,450
0,570 570,690 690,810 810,1200 1500,1860
questions, I'll be there and

2461
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:38,010
0,270 270,600 600,1200 1200,1500 1500,1560
I think maybe friends, if
