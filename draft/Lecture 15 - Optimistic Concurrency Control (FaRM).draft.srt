0,120 120,360 360,660 660,1020 1020,1170

0,300 300,480 480,720 720,930 930,1260
Okay, so that's sort of

221
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,100
0,300 300,750 750,930 930,1290 1290,1410

0,180 180,360 360,660 660,1110 1140,1830

0,120 120,180 180,480 480,780 780,1020
going to draw that as

233
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,920
0,450 540,960 960,1350 1350,1560 1560,1860
a single line,| of course

0,150 150,240 240,630 630,990 990,1710
it's a switch network internally,|

235
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,970
0,720 1140,2580 2820,3570 3570,4260 4410,4950
{} and basically shard,| {the,data,is}

236
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,480

sharded across these different machines|

237
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,880
0,930
and

238
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,170
0,720 810,1350 1350,1440 1440,1740 1740,2070
the level of sharing happens,

239
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,970

0,480 840,1410 1410,1560 1560,2160
so region is 2

0,810
gigabyte,|

242
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,840

243
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,610
0,120 120,450 450,870 870,1140 1140,1770

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,790

0,150 150,360 360,450 450,690 690,1380
so this is just DRM,|

247
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,800

{for,example} on the disk,| so

249
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,540
0,690 960,1920 2010,2760 2790,3150 3150,3420
basically, {} the total data

0,120 120,270 270,630 630,810 810,900
that you're using,| so if

254
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,770
0,210 210,600 600,690 690,1080 1080,1260
your dataset is larger than

255
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,580
0,90 90,300 300,420 420,480 480,810

0,90 90,210 210,270 270,480 480,780

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,550
0,150 150,240 240,360 360,630 630,930

259
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,320
0,180 180,480 480,540 540,810 810,1170
And again, the reason why

260
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,060
0,150 150,300 300,1350 1380,1680 1680,1740

0,180 180,600 600,720 720,1050 1050,1350
use DRAM is, because they

262
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,640
0,240 240,330 330,540 540,750 750,1230

269
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,880
0,120 120,270 270,870 1080,1530 1530,1710
they use replication| and so

270
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,860
0,180 180,750 750,1200 1200,1650 1650,1980
they replicate regions across multiple

0,210 210,660 870,1470 1470,1470 2220,2520
other reason,| then {} there's

0,150 150,540 690,960 960,1050 1050,1200
Of course, then we need

297
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,150
0,390 420,840 840,900 900,1200 1200,1830
some way of keeping track

0,300 300,1110 1200,1950

0,450 450,840 840,1290 1470,2190 2340,2640
Now there's one a serious

316
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,800
0,240 240,330 330,570 570,1110 1110,1470

0,120 120,390 390,630 630,810 810,990
I talked about like while

0,900 930,1080 1080,1290 1290,1530 1530,1650
then {you,know} one machine can

321
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,700

325
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,740
0,420 420,630 630,780 780,840 840,1350
is when there's a correlated

326
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,700

511
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,690
0,390 720,900 900,1050 1050,1680 1710,2070
good.| So let's talk so

512
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,790
0,540 660,930 930,1110 1110,1320 1320,2100

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,050
0,330 330,570 570,1020 1020,1410 1410,1890
gotten the stable storage devices

515
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,670
0,150 150,210 210,300 300,690 1110,1620
out of the way| and

516
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,790
0,630 660,840 840,990 990,1710 2550,3120
so there's no bottleneck for

517
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,290
0,390 390,660 660,960 960,1320 1320,1500
reading writing storage devices,| because

518
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,700
0,300 300,660 660,870 870,1140 1140,1410
they're basically not using them,|

519
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,140
0,420 420,660 660,870 870,990 990,1170
other than this is one

520
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,510
0,480 480,1050 1200,1530 1530,2010 2040,2370

0,180 180,570 690,960 960,1260 1260,1410
And so the next set

523
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,420
0,90 90,390 390,510 510,900 900,1320
of things they focus on|

524
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,600
0,150 150,450 450,570 570,1260 1260,3060

572
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,230
0,60 60,390 390,690 690,1740 2100,2340

0,120 120,450 450,630 630,750 750,990
the way they do that

0,60 60,180 180,750 1200,1380 1380,1530

0,90 90,240 240,390 390,630 630,870

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,400
0,120 120,930 930,1380 1380,1500 1500,1920

So the user level application,

600
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,510
0,210 210,330 330,690 690,1230 1230,1590
{you,know} can basically now {read,and,write}

601
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,820

0,210 210,390 390,720 720,780 780,960
So this cuts the whole

606
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,140
0,300 300,600 600,720 720,780 780,870

00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,990
0,600 780,1410 1410,2100 2100,2670 2670,2850

608
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,840
0,660 750,1320 2190,2580 2580,2640 2640,2850
performance considerably.| In the case

609
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,340
0,60 60,720 870,1170 1170,1320 1320,1500

611
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,710
0,120 120,480 480,750 750,900 900,1290
so one way of delivering

612
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,060
0,90 90,690 690,990 990,1080 1080,1350
a {packet,correct}| is the packet

00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,140
0,210 210,330 330,420 420,720 720,1080
comes in, the network interface

614
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,640
0,330 330,660 660,750 750,1440 1440,1500

0,360 360,510 510,990 990,1080 1080,1680

617
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:58,980
0,300 720,1290
that {}

618
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,300
0,90 90,360 360,480 480,1020 1260,1800
the packet has arrived,| and

619
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,160
0,1140 1140,1350 1350,1410 1410,1680 1680,1860
informally trying to avoid that

620
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,030
0,390 390,510 510,570 570,750 750,870

621
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,380
0,330 330,480 480,750 750,840 840,1350
avoid that cost is basically

622
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,160
0,180 180,900
they poll

623
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,080
0,480 480,900
{the,receive} queue.|

624
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,150
0,360 390,630 630,1080 1080,1830 1830,2310
So there's basically {an,user,level} thread

625
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,070
0,150 150,300 300,1200 1200,1350 1350,1890
you know {that,sits} in the

626
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,620
0,600 630,1590 1800,1980 1980,2340 2340,2520
FaRM application| and basically does

627
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,930
0,240 240,660 660,750 900,1620 1770,2310
nothing else than {sort,of,reading} {}

628
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,520
0,540 570,1170 1170,1290 1290,1440 1440,1590
the {receive,queue}| to see if

629
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,000
0,300 300,720 720,1260
actually {packet,is} available.|

630

0,210 210,420 420,990 990,1440 1440,1530
And so that requires you

631
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,340
0,330 330,450 450,690 690,720 720,1290

0,120 120,330 330,780 780,870 870,1170
so that avoids the use

633
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,780

0,120 120,480 480,750 750,1380 1380,1710
of basically having {a,polling} {}

638
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,580
0,120 120,480 1230,1620 1680,2220 2220,2400
than polling| and FaRM turns

0,480 480,750 750,1080 1080,1230 1230,1470
{} and then the NIC

690
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,030
0,120 120,330 330,420 420,660 660,780
will send it over to

691
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,130
0,570 600,1020 1050,1260 1260,1770 1770,2100
the NIC, the destination NIC,|

692
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,020
0,180 180,690 690,1290 1290,1440 1440,1620
the destination {NIC,sees} that this

693
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,580
0,450 480,780 780,1140 1140,1440 1440,1560
is a special packet an

694
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,470
0,510 510,930 1290,1500 1500,1800 1800,1890
RDMA packet| and looks at

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,570
0,90 90,720 720,1140 1140,1350 1350,2100
the instruction that goes along

696
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,010
0,150 150,240 240,690 690,1020 1350,1440
with the RDMA packet,| so

697
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,080
0,540 540,750 750,1020 1230,1890 1920,2070
{the,instruction} might be read a

698
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,460

700
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,760
0,510 510,660 660,780 780,1080 1080,1230
here so for example, let's

701
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,110
0,150 150,330 330,420 420,630 630,1350
say it's a read operation,|

702

0,690

703
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,380
0,240 240,300 300,510 510,900 900,990
and the read operation will

704
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,300
0,90 90,480 480,810 810,1140 1140,1920

0,300 300,420 420,630 630,720 720,810
{} you first have to

930
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,440
0,270 270,600 600,1050 1260,1500 1500,2310

00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,020
0,240 240,450 450,990 1020,1560 1560,1740
set up {} basically like

934
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,980
0,180 180,390 390,480 480,540 540,960
it's almost like a TCP

935
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,720
0,330 330,660 660,750 750,900 900,1740
channel,| except you know RDMA

936
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,760
0,540 540,1200 1320,1710 1710,1800 1800,2010
{doesn't,use} TCP,| but it sets

937
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,700
0,90 90,150 150,570 570,1320 1680,2940
up a connection oriented reliable,

938
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,700
0,870 870,1530 1560,2100 2100,2580
{} ordered {} channel,|

939
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,880
0,480 480,630 630,1080 1080,1500 1500,1800
and so the security checks

940
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,870
0,150 150,420 420,720 720,930 930,990
and access control checks are

941
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,740
0,360 360,450 450,540 540,780 780,870
happening at the point of

942
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,520
0,60 60,480
the setup.|

943
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,030
0,360 360,510 510,630 630,750 750,840
So would you have to

944
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,440
0,120 120,330 330,840 840,1140 1140,1410
do that between every pair

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,040
0,90 90,840 840,1350
of machines?| Yes.|

946
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,770
0,270 270,420 420,660 660,960 960,1170
So that would become really

947
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,540
0,540 540,660 660,1020 1050,1470 1500,1770
costly to add,| {} like

948
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,160
0,210 210,660 660,840 840,1260 1260,1620
one machine to a large

949
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,350
0,450 450,840 1170,1890 1890,2070 2070,2190
cluster, right?| You have n

950
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,300
0,510 510,1080 1080,1740
square RDMA connections,|

951
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,140
0,150 150,540 540,600 600,720 720,840
and otherwise we would have

952
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,780
0,120 120,450 450,780 780,1410
n square TCP connections,|

953
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,960
0,1080 1200,1680 1680,1830 1830,1950 1950,2310
not clear as a major

954
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,920
0,330 330,630
difference there.|

955
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,720
0,270 270,870 870,1080 1080,1200 1200,1680
And so just to clarify,

956
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,220
0,480 600,1050 1050,1320 1320,1410 1410,1500
so the message in the

957
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,170
0,480 480,900 900,1170 1170,1530 1530,1950

958
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,610
0,300 300,690 720,1170 1170,1260 1260,1440
also in memory,| they just

959
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,260
0,210 210,330 330,600 600,1260 1290,1650
sit in different places than

960
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,120
0,210 210,300 300,840 1170,1470 1470,1860

0,240 240,420 420,540 540,810 810,900
so if you do, so

962
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,980
0,180 180,240 240,480 480,660 660,900

0,180 180,300 300,570 570,1320 1350,1710
you know there's a region

0,210 600,810 810,900 900,1440 1440,1680
and there are regions in

969
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,850
0,120 120,600 600,750 750,1440 1470,2070

0,180 180,540 660,1020 1020,1560 1560,1770

direct access from memory,| so

978
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,570
0,240 240,390 390,480 480,660 660,930
since here we don't have

is not really suitable or

1177
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,780
0,300 300,570 570,1140 1140,1650 1860,2610
{nice -} nicely with {}

0,150 150,360 360,750 750,1230 1230,1770
or lines up nicely with

1179
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,440
0,210 210,1050 1140,1350 1350,1470 1470,1620
{} RDMA| and so they're

1180
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,580
0,150 150,240 240,450 450,750 750,1140
going to go to an

1181
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,950
0,570 570,1140 1230,1740 1740,2070 2070,2370
optimistic scheme,| where basically reading

1182
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:17,820
0,360 360,450 450,660 660,780 780,870
objects is not going to

1183
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,110
0,450 450,600 600,870 870,960 960,1290
require any locks at all,|

1184
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,070
0,180 180,360 360,540 540,870 870,930
you just can fetch an

1185
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,500
0,600 900,1530 1530,1950 1950,2190 2190,2430
object {} and start using

1186
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,300
0,300 300,630 870,1050 1050,1200 1200,1800
it| and as we'll see,

1187
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,380
0,510 510,600 600,690 690,930 930,990
{} {you,know} of course you

1188
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,790
0,180 180,270 270,480 480,900 900,1410
need to have some mechanism

1189
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,080
0,120 120,600 600,870 870,1020 1020,1290
to discover whether you're reading

1190
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,920
0,120 120,330 330,600 600,690 690,840
an old version and new

1191
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,090
0,480 660,780 780,930 930,990 990,1170
version,| and this is where

1192
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,050
0,60 60,360 360,780 780,840 840,960
the version numbers are going

1193
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,130
0,90 90,300 300,420 420,780 780,1080
to play an important role.|

1194
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,000
0,240 240,420 420,600 600,720 720,870
{} So when you read

1195
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,950
0,90 90,750 780,1110 1110,1350 1350,1950
an object {} in FaRM,|

1196
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:42,970
0,270 270,390 390,480 480,780 780,1020
you get the object back|

1197
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:43,870
0,90 90,180 180,300 300,570 570,900
and you can also the

1198
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:44,740
0,120 120,420 420,570 570,810 810,870
{} version number back to

1199
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,470
0,150 150,630 1140,1320 1320,1860 1890,2730
that object,| and then {}

1200
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,330
0,810 810,1350 1350,1470 1470,1710 1710,1830
basic idea is that at

1201
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,500
0,60 60,360 360,420 420,960
the point of commit,|

1202
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,090
0,1020 1410,1950 1950,2010 2010,2190 2190,2280
we're going to do a

1203
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,480
0,510 510,1320
validation step,|

1204
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,780
0,150 150,690 720,1110 1110,2640 2850,3480
to check that the objects

1205
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,310
0,360 360,660 690,1380 1380,1470 1470,1530
being {} [write] at the

1206
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,930
0,270 270,360 360,450 450,1200 1290,1620
beginning of the transaction,| or

1207
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,760
0,210 210,420 420,570 570,1230 1650,1830
actually having been modified.| And

1208
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,680
0,210 210,510 510,1080 1080,1440 1440,1920
so during validation check step,|

1209
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,820
0,150 150,450 450,570 570,690 690,1020
we're basically going to check

1210
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,260
0,150 150,900
for conflict,|

1211
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,270
0,330 330,420 420,810 810,900 900,1410
and the conflict is basically

1212
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,950
0,240 240,330 330,690 690,1200 1200,1680
if the version number {}

1213
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,080
0,270 270,390 390,1110 1260,1620 1620,2100
has been incremented| {you,know} since

1214
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,470
0,120 120,840 1140,2850 2850,3090 3090,3390
you know {the,coordinator} actually read

1215
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,300
0,150 150,690 870,1170 1170,1560 1560,1800
the object,| so {the,version} number

1216
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,320
0,90 90,690
are different,|

1217
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,900
0,990 1350,2160
different, then

1218
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,620
0,240 240,990 990,1170 1170,1620
the transaction is aborted,|

1219
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,140
0,510 510,630 630,780 780,1290 1290,1380
and if they're saying, are

1220
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,250
0,210 210,300 300,600 600,750 750,1110
still the same,| that basically

1221
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,930
0,270 270,390 390,960 990,1470 1470,1680
means that nobody no other

1222
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:47,350
0,630 630,1290 1800,2610 2610,3270 3270,3420
transaction modified the transaction, the

1223
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,270
0,660 900,1080 1080,1680 1680,1800 1800,1920
object| and then we can

1224
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,350
0,240 240,420 420,630 630,720 720,1080
actually go ahead and commit.|

1225
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,730
0,120 120,360 360,480 480,600 600,870
Of course, in the case

1226
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,560
0,300 300,960 960,1290 1290,1620 1620,1830
of abort,| {you,know} typical what

1227
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,660
0,300 300,510 510,720 720,1140 1290,2100
happen is that the {the,client}

1228
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,580
0,90 90,450 480,810 810,1770 1770,1920
you know maybe run the

1229
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,200
0,990 990,1290
{whole,transaction} again,|

1230
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,660
0,600 600,870 870,990 990,1020 1020,1260
perhaps waiting for a little

1231
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,700
0,480 480,1440 1440,1710 1710,1920 1920,2040
while before actually doing it,|

1232
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,170
0,600 600,900 930,1140 1140,1380 1380,1440
{for,some} random {} period of

1233
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:06,840
0,330
time.|

1234
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,920
0,270 270,510 510,630 630,1770 1770,2190
So that's the basic plan

1235
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,260
0,240 240,1080 1110,1320 1320,1650 1650,2250
right,| so {this,is} optimistic scheme,|

1236
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,600
0,210 210,450 450,810 810,1830 1860,2250
so that reads can completely

1237
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,540
0,720 750,1050 1050,1740 2010,2640 2640,2940
exploit {RDMA -}| {} and

1238
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,500
0,120 120,210 210,480 480,570 570,960
as we'll see, in fact

1239
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:21,260
0,600 600,840 840,1260 1260,1890 2160,2550
read would require any state

1240
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,270
0,630 660,1440 1440,1500 1500,1920 1920,2010
changes on the servers at

1241
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:23,800
0,300
all.|

1242
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,790
0,240 240,330 330,540 540,720 720,1290
And so this is basically

1243
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:28,650
0,180 180,270 270,630 720,1500 1500,1860
sort of the basic idea

1244
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:32,640
0,510 570,1050 1050,1470 3060,3540 3540,3990
behind figure 4,| except {you,know}

1245
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,420
0,120 120,300 300,390 390,420 420,780
we'll see in a second,|

1246
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,320
0,240 240,450 450,480 480,660 660,900
there's quite a bit more

1247
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,700
0,660 660,840 840,1140
complications to it.|

1248
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:38,380
0,270 270,630 660,1170 1170,1920 2010,2190
So this again {sort,of} {}

1249
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,100
0,120 120,300 300,390 390,630 630,720
I think I used this

1250
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:39,880
0,210 210,270 270,330 330,540 540,780
phrase in a little while

1251
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,110
0,240 240,330 330,510 510,780 780,1230
ago,| a couple lectures ago,|

1252
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,420
0,270 270,840 840,1650 1650,1770 1770,2190
the optimistic schema in contrast

1253
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,800
0,60 60,180 180,690 690,1050 1050,1380
to the pessimistic scheme is,|

1254
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,690
0,240 240,570 570,690 690,870 900,1740
you're basically going to assume

1255
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,620
0,180 180,390 390,750 750,810 810,930
that you're allowed to do

1256
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,150
0,120 120,900 1140,1290 1290,1380 1380,1530
the operation,| and if it

1257
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,260
0,240 240,450 450,600 600,780 780,1110
turns out you're not allowed

1258
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,370
0,60 60,240 240,300 300,990 990,1110
to sort of apologize and

1259
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,290
0,510 780,1200 1200,1350 1350,1440 1440,1920
abort,| {} in the pessimistic

1260
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,910
0,360 360,480 480,870 870,1380 1380,1620
case, you basically first ask

1261
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:55,960
0,150 150,720 720,810 810,930 930,1050
for approval to do the

1262

0,540 540,630 630,990 990,1560 1560,1740
then you basically guaranteed at

1264
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,240
0,270 270,660 840,1020 1020,1140 1140,1380
commit time, you can actually

1265
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:01,760
0,420
commit.|

1266
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,340

0,510 510,870 870,1680 1680,2220 2220,2520
there's like consistency across different

1274
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,430
0,780 1050,1200 1200,1350 1350,1470 1470,1710
objects,| so that you're not

1275
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,590
0,630 870,1170 1170,1770 1770,1860 1860,2160
reading one object and then

1276
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,180
0,390 390,630 630,930 930,1380 1380,1590
later reading another object,| but

1277
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,520
0,570 600,780 780,870 870,1560 1560,2340
those, but a transaction modified

1278
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,080
0,240 240,300 300,540 540,690 690,1230
some of those in between.|

1279
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,180
0,270 270,720 780,1020 1020,1590 1590,1830
Yeah well, {} that's a

1280
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,220
0,240 240,630 780,1410 1410,1530 1530,2040
great question| and so let's,

1281
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,480
0,300 450,750 750,930 930,1170 1170,1260
I think we're going to

1282
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,770
0,300 300,480 480,720 720,900 900,1290
get out, just gotta dive

1283
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,300
0,480 480,780 780,1050 1050,1410
into actually figure 4,|

1284
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:36,850
0,300 300,480 480,660 660,750 750,960
{} and which I think

1285
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:37,570
0,120 120,210 210,270 270,660 660,720
should be the core of

1286
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,480
0,150 150,630
this paper.|

1287
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,820
0,450 450,630 630,810 810,990 990,1380
{} So let's look at

1288
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,800
0,600 600,870 870,1380
{} figure 4,|

1289
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,480
0,840
and,

1290
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,540
0,330 330,570 570,690 690,1080
oops, not that one.|

1291
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:54,920
0,690

1292
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,100
0,420 420,570 570,840 840,1170
Alright, here figure 4,|

1293
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:00,970
0,150 150,270 270,330 330,540 540,810
we're going to spend quite

1294
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,140
0,30 30,150 150,210 210,720 750,1170
a bit of time {}

1295
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,550
0,360 360,660 660,780 780,1050 1050,1410
basically talking about figure 4.|

1296
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,480
0,720 1260,1590 1590,1860 1860,2340 2340,2520
{ -} So {the,first} {you,know}

1297
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,250
0,390 390,510 510,1350 1440,1680 1680,1770
things get oriented {} in

1298
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,500
0,210 210,780 780,1290 1320,2160 2160,2250
this figure 4,| {} you

1299
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,150
0,120 120,240 240,870 960,1290 1290,1650
know we see,| { -

1300
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,220
0,600 630,870 870,1050 1050,1260 1260,2310
-} so we have a

1301
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,920
0,450 450,1470 1590,1860 1860,2160 2160,2700
transaction coordinator, the C here,|

1302
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,720
0,480 480,600 600,930 930,1170 1170,1530
and it's really the transaction

1303
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,210
0,630 630,780 780,1200 1200,1980 2010,2490
coordinator is a application| and

1304
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:28,410
0,150 150,540 540,750 750,840 840,900
the application runs on the

1305
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,340
0,270 270,630 630,690 690,870 870,930
same machine, is one of

1306
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,530
0,210 210,480 480,1200 1470,2130 2130,2190
those 90 machines,| but the

1307
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:32,220
0,210 210,300 300,420 420,510 510,690
way I'm going to think

1308
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,450
0,270 270,450 630,1020 1020,1080 1080,1230
about it for the rest

1309
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:34,410
0,60 60,240 240,690 690,840 840,960
of those lectures,| that it

1310
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:35,490
0,180 180,360 360,420 420,750 750,1080
runs on a separate machine

1311
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,300
0,60 60,180 180,360 360,570 570,810
I don't really care about

1312
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,380
0,270 270,450 450,840 990,1620
it that much, okay?|

1313
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,210
0,180 180,630 630,630 630,1380 1380,1590
And then, {} there are

1314
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,770
0,240 240,690 990,1290 1290,1410 1410,1560
different shards,| {} in this

1315
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:42,940
0,300 300,420 420,480 480,690 690,1170
case there are 3 shards,

1316
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,180
0,570 570,1110 1110,1260 1260,1770 2100,2640
1 2 and 3,| and

1317
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,250
0,270 270,720 720,1200 1200,1680 1680,2070
each shard is replicated twice,

1318
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,330
0,270 270,330 330,420 420,900 900,1080
one's in the primary, one's

1319
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,120
0,60 60,150 150,510
in the backup.|

1320
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:54,050
0,690 1290,2220 2250,2370 2370,2700 2700,3000
{} Then {you,know} we'll see

1321
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:55,130
0,210 210,330 330,420 420,510 510,1080
that,| this is the execution

1322
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:56,300
0,240 240,360 360,450 450,1020 1020,1170
phase of the transaction,| so

1323
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,920
0,120 120,600 600,720 720,930 930,1620
the transaction is two phases,

1324
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,450
0,360 360,480 480,540 540,1110 1110,1410
one is the execution phase,

1325
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:02,030
0,300 300,360 360,630 630,1170 1860,2580
and then commit phase, {}|

1326
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:04,190
0,780 810,1170 1170,1290 1290,1890 1890,2160
and during the execution phase,|

1327
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:05,600
0,150 150,300 300,870 870,960 960,1410
this is where the transaction

1328
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,160
0,120 120,390 390,690 690,990 990,1560
is run,| so {does,it} begin,

1329
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,890
0,330 330,930 1200,1620 1650,2160 2160,2490
does read, for example in

1330
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:11,090
0,180 180,480 480,630 630,870 870,1200
this case the 3 objects

1331
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:12,470
0,90 90,300 300,630 780,870 870,1380
are being read| and one

1332
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,940
0,210 210,360 360,900 900,1230 1260,1470
that was located {} whose

1333
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,830
0,480 480,1020 1110,1380 1380,1800 1800,1890
primaries in one object that

1334
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:17,780
0,360 360,720 720,1020 1020,1440 1590,1950
actually {sit,in} shard 1,| one

1335
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,370
0,360 360,510 510,840 840,1170 1170,1590
object that's {sit,in} shard 3,|

1336
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:21,200
0,270 270,930 930,990 990,1440 1470,1830
one objects in shard 2,

1337
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,450
0,390 390,690 690,930 930,1290 1890,2790
alright {} {region 2}.| And

1338
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,660
0,990 1290,2130 2250,2580 2580,2670 2670,3060
{} the we can see,|

1339
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,740
0,360 360,690 690,870 870,930 930,1080
actually we look a little

1340
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,570
0,90 90,570 900,1410 1410,1590 1590,1830
bit ahead,| {} we'll see

1341
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,560
0,270 270,720
that the

1342
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,850
0,390 390,540 540,720 720,870 870,1020
{} the two of these

1343
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,530
0,360 360,450 450,690 690,1110 1110,1680
objects are actually being {}

1344
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,880
0,510 510,690 690,870 870,990 990,1260
written| and one of them

1345
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,440
0,180 180,450 450,810 1080,1260 1260,1560
is being read,| so the

1346
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,350
0,390 390,840 870,1920 1950,2370 2370,2850
object from number shard 3,|

1347
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,160
0,150 150,300 300,450 450,540 540,750
this is just a read

1348
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,750
0,570 660,960 960,1200 1200,1320 1320,1590
operation| and these are write

1349
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,000
0,690 1140,1320 1320,1470 1470,1680 1680,2250
operations,| these are read operations,|

1350
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,590
0,300 450,1080 1080,1380 1380,1470 1470,1590
but those objects are going

1351
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:47,600
0,60 60,180 180,810
to be modified.|

1352
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:50,100
0,510 540,1080 1080,1290 1290,1350 1350,1830
So basically as the transaction

1353
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,330
0,450 450,570 570,690 690,870 870,1230
runs,| you know it fetches

1354
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:54,210
0,480 480,1080 1080,1380 1380,2130 2160,2880
objects from different machines, modifies

1355
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,370
0,150 150,840 1020,1170 1170,1650 1650,2160
them locally| and then in

1356
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:58,770
0,180 180,510 510,1140 1260,1770 1770,2400
the commit phase, {} the

1357
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:00,690
0,510 510,720 720,930 930,1470 1620,1800
changes are being applied| and

1358
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:01,650
0,60 60,450 450,540 540,720 720,960
of course you know the

1359
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,180
0,330 330,780 780,1170 1170,1320 1320,1530
whole challenge here is that,|

1360
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,380
0,90 90,180 180,480 480,660 660,1200
in the end we want

1361
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,080
0,420 420,1260 1350,1650 1650,1950 1950,2340
to achieve {} strict {serializability

1362
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:07,920
0,480
-}.|

1363
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,400
0,390

1364
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:18,540
0,840

1365
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,570
0,180 180,270 270,540 540,1140 1170,1830
And in some ways, {}

1366
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,130
0,720 1860,3030 3810,4200 4200,4350 4350,4530
the protocol for at least

1367
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:27,590
0,660 720,1200 1200,1800 1830,2160 2160,2460
writes, always follows a very

1368
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:29,150
0,540 540,660 660,900 900,1140 1140,1560
similar {two-phase -} commit protocols,

1369
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:29,810
0,150 150,300 300,510 510,570 570,660
that we've seen in the

1370
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:30,980
0,450 450,720 720,780 780,1110 1110,1170
past,| there are differences in

1371
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,570
0,90 90,750 900,1260 1260,1320 1320,1590
the details,| but the basic

1372
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:34,610
0,420 420,570 570,630 630,1140 1380,2040
strategy is the same, {}|

1373
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:35,780
0,390 390,510 510,690 690,1020 1020,1170
and you know we can

1374
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,820
0,330 420,840 840,1170 1200,1380 1380,2040
sort,| {} so let's assume

1375
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:39,020
0,390 390,540 540,660 660,870 870,990
that now we're done with

1376
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,820
0,90 90,600 600,900 900,1200 1200,1800
the execution phase,| so we're

1377
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:41,570
0,240 240,330 330,450 450,570 570,660
we're at the end of

1378
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:43,010
0,90 90,690 690,870 900,990 990,1440
the transaction| and the transaction

1379
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:43,550
0,60 60,180 180,240 240,420 420,540
is going to try to

1380
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:44,080
0,390
commit,|

1381
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,330
0,300 300,720 720,840 840,960 960,1080
that transaction that could be

1382
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:46,560
0,180 180,660 660,750 750,870 870,1230
two outcomes,| you know actually

1383
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,120
0,180 180,690 690,1020 1020,1260 1260,1560
{you,know} successfully commits or actually

1384
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:48,900
0,570
aborts,|

1385
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,130
0,480 600,930 930,1050 1050,1320 1320,1710
{} {and,the} {aborts -} because

1386
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:52,870
0,120 120,390 390,840 840,1050 1050,1740
some other transaction ran concurrently

1387
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:53,950
0,150 150,630 630,810 810,900 900,960
and modifies one of the

1388
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,480
0,450 450,870 870,990 990,1200 1200,1530
objects,| that we either read

1389
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,680
0,240 240,480 480,690 690,810 810,1200
or were trying to write.|

1390
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,640
0,690

1391
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,170
0,570 900,1140 1140,1260 1260,1500 1500,1980
And so the first thing,

1392
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,760
0,300 300,450 450,510 510,1140 1200,1590
that sort of protocol, the

1393
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,650
0,270 270,690 690,1050 1050,1530 1560,1890
commit phase basically has 5

1394
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,510
0,540 540,660 660,900 900,1200 1470,1860
steps,| you know the lock

1395
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:08,310
0,420 420,510 510,1050 1050,1680 1710,1800
step, the validation step, the

1396
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,810
0,240 240,600 600,1050 1050,1170 1170,1500
commit backup step, the commit

1397
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:11,400
0,690 780,960 960,1110 1110,1290 1290,1590
primary and then the truncate,|

1398
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,290
0,330 330,450 450,990 990,1320 1320,1890
and the truncate basically runs

1399
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,200
0,930 930,1620 1650,1920 1920,2580 2580,2880
{} almost {} lazily| and

1400
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,670
0,180 180,360 360,540 540,930 930,1470
so it's not particularly important,|

1401
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,890
0,480 480,690 690,900 900,1440 1440,2010
basically for our perspective, basically

1402
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:21,120
0,150 150,420 420,540 540,930 930,1170
the point of interest where

1403
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,310
0,270 270,330 330,960 1260,1710 1710,2190
things are stopping is here,|

1404
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,210
0,180 180,390 390,540 540,720 720,840
so that's sort of the

1405
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:26,160
0,240 240,360 360,450 450,1200 1230,1950
end of the transaction is.|

1406
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,920
0,300 300,780
Okay, so

1407
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,490
0,510 570,720 720,810 810,960 960,1290
{} each of these objects

1408
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,140
0,180 180,420 420,1050 1080,1200 1200,1650
have said before,| you know

1409
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,070
0,180 180,300 300,480 480,720 720,930
when you read them has

1410
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,510
0,30 30,360 360,510 510,1110 1110,1440
a version, {here's} a version

00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:35,440
0,540
number,|

1412
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,050
0,690 1200,1920 1950,2220 2220,2610 2610,2760
{} and {} there are

1413
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,700
0,690 690,810 810,1320 1320,1530 1530,1650
modifiers it locally,| then at

1414
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,570
0,90 90,360 360,450 450,780 780,870
the point of this,| you

1415
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:43,710
0,90 90,390 390,600 600,960 960,1140
know when when this this

1416
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:45,120
0,120 120,210 210,480 480,870 1230,1410
is the commit point,| where

1417
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,590
0,240 240,390 390,870 870,1230 1230,1470
when the application calls and

1418
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,920
0,690 960,1080 1080,2220 2430,3150 3150,3330
transaction,| the {} protocol, but

1419
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,960
0,150 150,660 780,1230 1230,1530 1530,2040
this whole commit phase protocol

1420
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,720
0,330 330,510
kicks in.|

1421
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:54,960
0,540 540,990 990,1110 1110,1200 1200,1410
{} And so the first

1422
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,550
0,120 120,240 240,780 810,1260 1260,1590
thing it does {} is|

1423
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:58,020
0,180 180,450 450,600 600,960 960,1470
what's called the locking step,

1424
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:00,450
0,330 330,540 540,1020 1230,1890 2040,2400
step number 1| and {the,goal}

1425
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:01,470
0,420 420,540 540,720 720,960 960,1020
here, in this step is

1426
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:03,090
0,90 90,390 390,870 870,1410 1440,1620
to basically acquire locks on

1427
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,710
0,210 210,360 360,1020 1050,1440 1440,1620
all the objects that are

1428
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,600
0,270 270,660
being written,|

1429
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,010
0,390 390,570 570,690 690,810 810,900
{} and so we can

1430
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,030
0,360 360,510 510,780 780,870 870,1020
see {you,know} based on this

1431
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,520
0,630 630,1020 1350,1890 1890,2100 2100,2490
diagram,| that apparently two objects

1432
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,880
0,930 960,1230 1230,1740 1770,2730 2730,3360
are being written namely {}

1433
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,430
0,720 1080,1320 1320,2130 2130,2430 2430,2850
the this object,| because context

1434
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:19,380
0,60 60,330 330,870 870,1380 1590,1950
is the primary of {}

1435
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,090
0,270 270,630 630,930 930,1380 1530,1710
shard 1, region 1| and

1436
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,260
0,390 390,390 390,750 750,1080 1080,1170
then {} this object is

1437
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,550
0,240 240,480 540,930 930,1170 1170,1290
being read,| {} that is

1438
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,380
0,240 240,810 810,1290 1290,1590 1590,1830
actually located on region 2,

1439
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,690
0,390 720,1230 1230,1350 1350,1590 1590,1920
right,| apparently the third object

1440
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:28,650
0,120 120,240 240,570 630,810 810,960
that we read you know

1441
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:31,530
0,300 300,690 690,1230 1590,2490 2640,2880
for primary 3,| {} it's

1442
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:33,870
0,510 510,660 660,900 900,1890 2040,2340

1443

it doesn't participate in the

1444
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,220
0,300 300,840
locking phase.|

1445
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,560
0,630 780,930 930,1020 1020,1290 1290,1860
So in the locking phase,|

1446
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:39,840
0,1020

1447
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,200
0,600 630,1080 1080,1350 1350,1590 1590,1800
txhe arrows actually have all

0,210 210,390 390,660 660,1290 1410,1620
kinds of different meanings,| so

1449
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:47,030
0,210 210,690 690,1590 2160,2880 2910,3210
these dashed arrows are {one-sided

a log,| so I'm just

1470
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,150
0,150 150,330 330,450 450,570 570,990
gonna draw it like this,|

1471
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,830
0,390 390,1140 1350,1890 1890,2730 2730,2850

0,60 60,270 270,750 1110,1380 1440,1740
a different color,| so here

1473
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,040
0,120 120,330 330,450 450,900 900,1470

00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,350
0,390 390,1140 1140,1440 1440,1800 1800,1890

0,810 810,1200 1200,1410 1410,1890

1480
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,540
0,540 540,900 900,1500 1530,1860 1860,1980
to the log,| I'm going

1481
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,050
0,60 60,180 180,270 270,300 300,510
to make it a big

1482
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:09,400
0,390 390,540 540,720 810,1140 1140,1350

1483
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,020
0,180 180,300 300,510 930,1350 1350,1620
what's in it| and it

1484
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,430
0,210 210,390 390,720 720,1170 1260,1410
is new version number of

00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:13,780
0,90 90,420 420,540 540,900 900,1350
the time of the {read,or,write}|

1486
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,590
0,90 90,360 360,420 420,690 690,810
and when the object is

1487
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:15,790
0,300 300,420 420,600 600,900 900,1200
read, so that version number

1488
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:17,100
0,180 180,420 420,570 570,960
that came out here,|

1489
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,190
0,420 420,630 630,840 840,1110 1110,1500
{} that comes back into

1490
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,140
0,270 270,570 570,1080 1260,1500 1500,1950
the log record,| the object

00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,900
0,570 600,900 900,1110 1110,1560 2160,2760
id that's being read and

1492
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:25,800
0,90 90,270 270,690 690,810 810,900
the new value for the

0,690

1494
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,150
0,420 420,870 900,1080 1080,1410 1410,1590
and so this record is

1495
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:34,210
0,330 360,840 840,1080 1170,2040 2220,3060
just {appended -} {you,know,to} the

0,510 660,2130 2310,2760 2760,3000 3000,3090
you know primary one and

1497
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:41,080

0,120 120,240 240,510 510,870 870,1440
And so there's some thread

1500
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,990

0,150 150,420 420,570 570,690 690,1440
then actually does some operations,|

1503
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,390
0,390 390,630 630,750 750,870 870,1200

0,240 240,390 390,720 720,960 960,1110
in this particular case, what

1511
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:05,190

0,120 120,390 390,840 870,1440 1440,1530
can actually be modified in

1662
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,120
0,180 180,660 660,840 840,900 900,1350
this particular point of time,|

1663
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,020
0,210 210,420 420,540 540,630 630,720
so that's sort of the

1664
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,790
0,750 750,1110 1110,1410 1410,1560 1560,1770
serialization point for the write

1665
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:58,940
0,210 210,300 300,390 390,870
part of the transaction.|

1666
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,060
0,180 180,510
Make sense?|

1667
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,760
0,390 390,630 630,900
Yes, thank you.|

1668
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,850
0,420 720,990 990,1170 1170,1800 2100,2790
Good okay, so now, {}

1669
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,780
0,150 150,300 300,390 390,690 690,900
you might have felt like,|

1670
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,610
0,1110 1140,1410 1410,1590 1590,1710 1710,1830
{} why not do the

1671
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:14,440
0,240 240,540 540,870 870,1350 1380,1830
same thing for read, correct,|

1672
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,430
0,270 270,450 450,600 600,690 690,990
and {you,know} get the lock

1673
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,260
0,120 120,210 210,600 600,1140 1140,1830
for the read objects, {}|

1674
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,160
0,210 210,270 270,510 510,750 750,900
get the lock from the

1675
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,540
0,420 420,660 660,1050 1050,1170 1170,1380
objects that read,| {you,know} check

1676
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,530
0,60 60,330 330,600 600,810 810,990
the version number in {you,know}

1677
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:21,500
0,60 60,210 210,690
in good [shape].|

1678
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,380
0,810 870,1020 1020,1620 1620,2160 2190,2520
And the reason that that

1679
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,700
0,90 90,420 420,510 510,900 900,1320
is actually a separate phase,|

1680
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,100
0,300 300,390 390,900 900,1410 1830,2400
namely the validation phase is

1681
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,470
0,540 540,900 900,1380 1380,1560 1560,2370
to basically avoid these expensive

1682
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,420
0,270 270,720 720,930 960,1530 1800,1950
write {RDMAs -}, right,| if

1683
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,320
0,120 120,270 270,360 360,510 510,900
you look at this vertical

1684
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,400
0,390 390,540 540,720 720,960 960,1080
step,| you'll see there's a

1685
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,260
0,210 210,810 990,1200 1200,1530 1530,1860
write RDMA,| the server has

1686
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,480
0,210 240,600 600,1140 1170,1860 1860,2220
to run something, basically does

1687
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,730
0,570 570,1110 1110,1200 1200,1710 2100,2250
{} acquiring the locks| and

1688
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,110
0,210 210,630 630,780 780,1140 1140,1380
then responds with another write

1689
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:43,610
0,450 450,570 570,1050 1050,1410 1410,1500
RDMA.| So here this is

1690
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:45,120
0,120 120,510 510,1230
a full RPC,|

1691
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,610
0,240 240,450 450,1050 1050,1350 1350,2130
that actually requires server participation|

1692
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,230
0,270 270,420 420,540 540,780 780,870
and as we'll see in

1693
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:52,630
0,30 30,510 750,1170 1170,1770 2190,2400
a second in the,| to

1694
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:54,520
0,510 510,810 810,1290 1410,1620 1620,1890
handle the read the objects

1695
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,190
0,180 180,390 390,780 1050,1830 1890,2670

0,300 510,900 1050,1770 1770,2010 2010,2160
the the FaRM uses this

1697
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:00,820
0,480 480,750 750,840 840,930 930,1410
validation step,| in the validation

1698

0,390 420,780 780,1110 1110,1650 1650,2100
step, just used one-sided {RDMAs

1699
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,690
0,390 540,810 810,930 930,1170 1170,1770
-}| and so there's no

1700
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,480
0,270 270,630 630,1080 1080,1650
real server involvement necessary.|

1701
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:12,920
0,570
Okay?|

1702
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,760
0,510 510,1140 1170,1410 1410,1680 1680,1860
So, {} what happens on

1703
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,020
0,300 300,540 600,1050 1050,1110 1110,1260
the,| so basically at this

1704
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:19,150
0,450 450,900 930,1410 1410,1590 1590,2130

0,90 90,510 510,1080 1080,1350 1350,1770
the transaction coordinator actually has

1706
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,200
0,420 750,1140 1140,1740 1950,2130 2130,2280
the write locks| and now

1707
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,010
0,90 90,330 330,450 450,540 540,810
the only thing it does

1708
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:25,510
0,60 60,360 360,1080 1080,1290 1290,1500
is,| it validates the read

1709
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:27,280

0,390 390,960 1020,1470 1530,2010 2040,2250
And so it {} for

1712
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:32,140
0,540 540,900 900,1020 1020,1140 1140,1410

00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,840
0,270 270,600 600,960 960,1170 1170,1380
our particular example,| that's only

1715
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,980
0,240 240,870 870,990 990,1050 1050,1140

at region 3,| {} so

1719
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:43,510
0,480 480,990 990,1080 1080,1440 1440,1500
it's, {} it basically is

1730
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,100

transaction abort again.|

0,60 60,150 150,480 480,720 720,1350
of the version numbers basically,|

1758
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:51,410
0,690 810,1410 1410,2130 2130,2370 2370,2520
and {} they also would

1759
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:53,510
0,120 120,420 420,1020 1080,1560 1560,2100
get basically strict {serializability -},|

1760
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,160
0,330 330,510 510,1140 1290,1500 1500,1620
because any transaction that will

1761
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,350
0,480 480,1080 1110,1350 1350,1770 1770,2190
start after your transaction commits,

1762
00:59:58,350 --> 00:59:59,760
0,150 150,360 360,630 630,900 900,1410
will have higher version number,|

1763
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:00,930
0,180 180,540 540,750 750,870 870,1140
so therefore {it,also} will commit

1764
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:01,540
0,300
later.|

1765
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:06,060
0,330 330,480 480,660 660,810 810,1350
Okay, so this is the

1766
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,490
0,660 660,1020 1020,1140 1140,1830 1860,2100
point basically {} where {}

1767
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:11,430
0,390 390,960 960,1470 1770,2610 2700,2940
transaction coordinator says,| {} {you,know}

1768
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:12,480
0,120 120,270 270,780 810,900 900,1050
at this point you know

1769
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,560
0,420
the,|

1770
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:15,460
0,450 450,660 660,870 870,1050 1050,1230
{} we know that all

1771
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:16,570
0,450 450,600 600,720 720,990 990,1110
the we have to, we

1772
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:17,890
0,120 120,480 480,570 570,1080 1080,1320
have acquired the locks,| we

1773
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,810
0,300 300,870 870,930 930,1500 1500,1920
have verified to validate the

1774
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:21,580
0,450 450,720 720,870 870,1500 1500,1710
version numbers for the read

1775
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,570
0,390 390,510 510,660 660,870 870,990
objects| and so this is

1776
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:24,180
0,480 480,570 570,840 840,1080
basically the commit point

1777
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:26,690
0,150 150,240 240,540 540,600 600,690
or the start of the

1778
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,310
0,270 270,480 480,840 900,1170 1170,1620
commit point,| so this point

1779
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,180
0,210 210,330 330,630 630,780 780,840
that is actually going to

1780
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,650
0,480 750,960 960,1170 1170,1320 1320,1470
say,| {} okay, I'm gonna

1781
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:31,700
0,330 330,480 480,720 720,870 870,1050
go, {} I'm gonna go

1782
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:32,480
0,510
commit.|

1783
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,290
0,420 420,540 540,690 690,900 900,1170
And you know there's a

1784
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:37,900
0,840 930,1500 1500,2280 2280,2340 2340,2610
multiple messages necessary to commit

1785
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,370
0,300 300,540 540,810 810,1200 1200,1470
point,| we'll {see,in,a} second| and

1786
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,750
0,360 360,450 450,960 960,1140 1140,1350
those are mostly for fault

1787
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,860
0,900
{tolerance,reasons}.|

1788
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,760
0,810

1789
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,930
0,420 420,720 720,1050 1080,1320 1320,1530
And so at this point,|

1790
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:48,120
0,540 540,570 570,1380 1380,1500 1500,2190
namely {} only the primary

1791
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,610
0,420 420,900 930,1320 1620,2100 2100,2250
has been the, only the

1792
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:53,220
0,750 780,1050 1050,1230 1230,2010 2190,2610
primaries have been contacted of

1793
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,890
0,660 1110,1890 2190,2340 2340,2400 2400,2670
the {} of the objects

1794
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:56,850
0,120 120,180 180,330 330,840 840,960
that are being modified,| but

1795
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:57,900
0,210 210,270 270,480 480,900
not the {backups -}.|

1796
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,080
0,180 180,240 240,540 540,810 810,960
And of course we want

1797
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,640
0,60 60,510 510,810 810,1350 1350,1560
to ensure that {} and

1798
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:02,020
0,510 510,600 600,840 870,1260 1260,1350
write,| you know once you

1799
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:04,930
0,480 750,1290 1290,1560 1560,2310 2340,2910
commit {} will survive f

1800
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:06,490
0,450 480,750 750,1020 1020,1140 1140,1560
failures, right,| system is designed

1801
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:09,640
0,1230 1230,1470 1530,1770 1770,2310 2970,3150
to {f+1 -} failures,| in

1802
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,920
0,150 150,540 540,1200 1230,1770 1770,2280
our particular designs, there's {}

1803
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:13,810
0,450 450,1020 1020,1200 1200,1410 1410,1500
one backup| and so it

1804
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:15,430
0,120 120,540 540,960 960,1200 1200,1620
can only survive one failure.|

1805
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:17,920
0,240 240,390 390,570 570,900 900,990
And so what happens is

1806
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,720
0,330 330,840 1020,1470 1470,1710 1710,1800
this {} final phase, {}|

1807
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,370
0,270 270,540 540,1020 1080,1290 1290,1650
commit backup phase is actually

1808
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:23,350
0,120 120,240 240,390 390,930 1200,1980
we're going to write to

1809
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,750
0,540 720,1440 1440,1590 1590,1740 1740,2190
the logs of the primary

1810
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:27,880
0,150 150,210 210,870 870,1290 1950,2100
of the backups,| so the

1811
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,660
0,450 450,750 780,1560
backups have log,|

1812
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:31,710
0,150 150,450 450,690 690,810 810,1500
so here's {backup -} i,|

1813
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:32,670
0,120 120,240 240,660 660,840 840,900
you know similar there's a

1814
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:35,040
0,300 300,630 630,750 750,990 1620,2370
log entry in it| and

1815
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,680
0,660 1230,1530 1530,1620 1620,1830 1830,2340
{} what we're gonna do

1816
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:40,170
0,810 960,1470 1500,1950 1950,2220 2220,2460
is write {} what's called

1817
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:41,980
0,120 120,510 510,900 900,1350
{} commit backup record,|

1818
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:43,560
0,60

1819
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,700
0,270 270,390 390,900 900,1110 1110,1200
and the commit {backup -}

1820
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,200
0,540 540,960 960,1110 1110,1170 1170,1500
record exactly as the same

1821
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,650
0,600 600,1440 1770,2160 2160,3060 3090,3450
information as the locking record

1822
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:57,880
0,120 120,210 210,420 420,870 870,1230
that we saw earlier,| so

1823
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:58,990
0,240 240,540 750,870 870,990 990,1050
in it is going to

1824
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:00,550
0,120 120,180 180,540 540,1170 1410,1560
be the version number, the

1825
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,880
0,900 1230,2070 2130,2550 2550,3120 3150,3330
oid and {} the new

1826
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:04,520
0,420
value.|

1827
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:11,290
0,780 1710,2400 2490,2760 2760,2940 2940,3420
Okay, and this is {you,know}

1828
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:12,670
0,240 240,870 900,1050 1050,1140 1140,1380
like before this is actually

1829
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:16,030
0,390 390,930 1320,1710 1710,2250 2610,3360
done using a write RDMA,|

1830
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:22,360
0,270 270,360 360,750 750,990 990,1170
now the backup doesn't really

1831
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,160
0,150 150,240 240,390 390,870 900,1800
have to do any operation

1832
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,240
0,450 450,600 600,900 900,1020 1020,1080
at this point,| like the

1833
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,260
0,360 360,600 600,660 660,750 750,1020
server side of the backup

1834
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,190
0,240 240,420 420,570 570,690 690,930
doesn't really have to run

1835
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:29,590
0,540 630,960 960,1200 1200,1530 1560,2400
anything,| {} just need {}

1836
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:31,630
0,510 690,870 870,1050 1050,1350 1590,2040
and and so the the

1837
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,730
0,270 270,450 450,960 1050,1530 1530,2070
here's this trick,| {} where

1838
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:34,990
0,450 450,540 540,840 840,1080 1080,1230
basically the center [] and

1839
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:36,340
0,600 600,690 690,780 780,1170
acknowledgement of the NIC.|

1840
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,900
0,240 240,720 810,1410 1740,1920 1920,2100
And so this you know

1841
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,610
0,630 630,750 750,960 960,1050 1050,1710
this is not {} one-sided

1842
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:43,070
0,570 600,990 990,1710 1830,2130 2130,2220
or write RDMA,| this is

1843
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:44,600
0,240 240,510 510,1200 1200,1380 1380,1530
just make acknowledging that it

1844
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,070
0,330 330,450 450,720 720,1350 1350,1470
got the write RDMA| and

1845
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,300
0,210 210,450 450,930 930,1080 1080,1230
the write RDMA has been

1846
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:48,040
0,570
performed.|

1847
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:49,910
0,150 150,240 240,450 450,750 750,1530
And so that basically acknowledges

1848
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:50,720
0,120 120,210 210,420 420,510 510,810
you know when we get

1849
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:51,920
0,330 330,690 690,960 960,1020 1020,1110
this particular point in the

1850
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,710
0,750 960,1140 1140,1710 1710,2190 2190,2790
protocol,| the transaction coordinator knows

1851
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:57,380
0,690 1350,2010 2040,2310 2310,2400 2400,2520
the object is in the

1852
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,790
0,330 330,450 450,570 570,660 660,1410
log of all the primaries|

1853
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,770
0,330 330,690 690,1020 1050,1470 1470,1620
and objects in {} in

1854

0,180 180,360 360,630 630,810 810,870
And so now we're in

1857
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:04,250
0,60 60,240 240,660 660,750 750,960
{} good position in {terms,of}

1858
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:06,170
0,90 90,300 300,780 780,1140 1140,1920
of fault tolerance, correct,| because

1859
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,300
0,750 840,1050 1050,1590 1620,1830 1830,1920

0,90 90,270 270,870 960,1230 1230,1410
the two fails,| the other

1861
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:10,910
0,390 390,510 510,780 780,1110 1110,1200
one can actually apply the

1862
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:12,180
0,300 300,810
write operation.|

1863
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:17,230
0,240 240,600 630,960 960,1560 2610,3360
Then there's one more step

1864
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:18,670
0,360 360,570 570,660 660,780 780,1440
that needs to be performed,|

1865
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:21,340
0,150 150,360 360,480 480,1500 1770,2400
and that is to commit

01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,480

0,180 180,360 360,660 660,960 960,1110
little bit later in more

1868
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:26,320
0,600 810,1590 2070,2310 2310,2430 2430,2730

1869
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,330
0,330 330,630 630,1320 1470,1830 1830,2010
final step,| where {} there's

0,150 150,390 390,600 600,720 720,990
I didn't write that down

1878
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:48,260
0,90 90,180 180,450 450,870 870,1050

01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,380
0,630 630,690 690,960 960,1350

01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,310
0,90 90,660 750,960 960,1080 1080,1350
of time,| which is actually

1902
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:38,760

really truly committed,|

0,150 150,330 330,420 420,690 720,960

0,270 270,690
commit point.|

1905

0,180 180,510 510,870 870,1230 1230,1530
The commit starts basically here|

1906
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:46,070
0,90 90,210 210,330 330,600 600,720
and this is actually the

1907
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:47,720
0,330 330,600 600,1020 1290,1470 1470,1650
actual commit point,| at that

1908
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,610
0,300 300,480 480,540 540,1140 1290,1890
particular point in time, the

1909
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,890
0,600 600,1110 1110,1530 1530,1590 1590,2250
transaction coordinator informs the application,|

1910
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:53,900
0,540 570,750 750,1230 1230,1410 1410,1920
yes, your transaction has committed,

1911
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,780
0,810 810,1050 1050,1410
and is done.|

1912
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:58,820
0,480 630,780 780,960 960,1110 1110,1350
Then, of course your point

1913
01:04:58,820 --> 01:04:59,750
0,330 330,420 420,720 720,840 840,930
later,| the logs need to

1914
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:01,370
0,90 90,750 750,990 990,1380 1380,1620
be cleaned and shortened up

1915
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:02,300
0,120 120,630 630,720 720,840 840,930
and truncated and all that

1916
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:02,960
0,150 150,210 210,450 450,540 540,660
kind of stuff| and this

1917
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,910
0,90 90,240 240,300 300,870 870,1950
is like the truncate {phase

1918
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:07,310
0,540 750,930 930,1110 1110,1590 1590,2370
-}| and that's basically {[],back}

1919
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:09,080
0,240 240,750 750,1230 1230,1680 1680,1770
on later locking phases and

1920
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,680
0,480 480,1140
validation phases.|

1921

0,150 150,270 270,360 360,570 570,780
really going to talk about

1923
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:14,340
0,120 120,240 240,570 570,1080 1080,1530
it at all,| but basically

1924
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:15,180
0,90 90,180 180,330 330,750 750,840
they have to truncate the

1925
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:16,620
0,780 780,900 900,1050 1050,1200 1200,1440
logs,| so that they don't

1926
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,020
0,390 390,960
grow unbounded.|

1927
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,330
0,510 780,1440 1440,1920 1920,2400 2640,3690
{} Sorry, but the hardware

1928
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,730
0,600 600,1020 1020,1470 1470,1620 1620,2370
acts, they just go directly

1929
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:30,920
0,870
into,

1930
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,800
0,510 510,1140 1560,1920 1920,2100 2100,2340
into the NIC of the

1931
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,590
0,600 600,2310 2310,2460 2460,2580 2580,2790

1932
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:37,970
0,60 60,150 150,600 600,1020 1050,1380
to the RDMA picture, right,|

1933
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,590
0,240 240,390 390,510 510,780 780,1230
so if a write RDMA

1934
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:40,460
0,660
happens,|

1935
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:43,100
0,570 570,720 720,1080 1080,1320 1320,2010

0,690 750,1230 1230,1800 1800,1920 1920,2160
the sender coordinator was running

1937
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:46,640
0,90 90,420 420,750 780,990 990,1230
{} here, right,| and here's

1938
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,270
0,150 150,270 270,450 450,540 540,630

0,660 660,900 900,1260 1260,1530 1530,1950
and so the write RDMA

1941
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:53,080
0,240 240,630 660,1170 1170,1470 1470,1530
goes in,| write maybe an

0,150 150,390 390,630 630,1050 1170,1680
the NIC does that, NIC

0,390 390,480 480,1080 1080,1200 1200,1650
and the coordinator will see

1946
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:03,170
0,180 180,810 810,930 930,990 990,1350

01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,370
0,180 180,540 540,660 660,750 750,990
and knows that the write

1954
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:18,700
0,180 180,390 390,1020
RDMA they succeeded.|

1955
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,230
0,210 210,600 600,1230 1260,1710 1740,2310
So does the write RDMA

1956
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:27,280
0,150 150,480 480,840 840,930 930,1050
is only write to the

1957
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,010
0,450 450,1020 1650,2190 2190,2580 2580,2730
log, they.| They're used in

1958
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:31,930
0,180 180,840 900,1410 1410,1620 1620,1920
two cases,| {} they're both

1959
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:33,490
0,270 270,510 510,690 690,1050 1050,1560
used for these message queues

1960
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,220
0,270 270,540 540,1800 2280,2550 2550,2700
and for the {} the

1961
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,440
0,450 480,840
log append.|

1962
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:42,400
0,210 210,330 330,450 450,570 570,780
And so when we say

1963
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,380
0,660 660,960 960,1290 1290,1830 1830,1980
that a write RDMA has

1964
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:45,670
0,150 150,660 660,780 780,1050 1050,1290
been performed,| we mean that

1965
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,510
0,90 90,240 240,390 390,780 780,840
it has been appended to

1966
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:47,950
0,90 90,510 540,810 810,1110 1110,1440
the log| and not actually

1967
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:49,990
0,600 600,1200 1200,1440 1440,1560 1560,2040
executed necessarily by the application.|

1968
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:52,030
0,300 300,720 720,900 900,1320 1710,1980
That's correct, that's correct, {}|

1969
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:53,440
0,270 270,900 900,1020 1020,1170 1170,1410
so {for,example} you know to

1970
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,880
0,60 60,360 360,630 630,870 930,1440
for example do the backup

1971
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,850
0,90 90,630 870,1860 1890,2730 2760,2970
to actually {} perform the

1972
01:06:57,850 --> 01:06:59,020
0,300 300,390 390,480 480,990 990,1170
update to the object,| you

1973
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,430
0,300 300,750 750,990 990,1080 1080,1410
need to read the log

1974
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,450
0,390 390,480 480,600 600,930 930,1020
entry and then apply the

1975
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,000
0,420
update.|

1976
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:04,810
0,150 150,360 360,480 480,810 810,1080
I see, and also for

1977
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:06,400
0,210 210,570 570,840 840,1110 1110,1590
the log bit for every

1978
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,140
0,450 450,690 690,960 960,1320 1320,1740
object,| so since everything resides

1979
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:09,190
0,270 300,690 690,780 780,900 900,1050
in memory,| and we have

1980
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,300
0,480 480,630 630,870 870,1050 1050,1110
{like,64 -} bits for the

1981
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,980
0,270 270,780 990,1350 1350,1410 1410,1680
version number plus the log

1982
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,330
0,270 450,750 750,900 900,1230 1230,1350
bit,| so I'm assuming that

1983
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:14,230
0,90 90,300 300,630 630,810 810,900
it can fit in a

1984
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,450
0,540 540,930 930,1470 1680,2130 2130,2220
single memory address,| but we

1985
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,350
0,120 120,330 330,450 450,540 540,900
can still have the problem

1986
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:19,240
0,150 150,510 510,660 660,1080 1080,1890
of,| let's say the processor

1987
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:21,040
0,570 570,780 780,1110 1110,1500 1500,1770
fetching that memory address into

1988
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,930
0,840 1110,1410 1410,1560 1560,1680 1680,1890
register| {} and then maybe

1989
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:23,890
0,210 210,300 300,480 480,690 690,960
if we have a multi

1990
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:26,770
0,600 1200,1710 1710,2010 2010,2400 2400,2880
core machine,| then another core

1991
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:29,440
0,480 480,1350 1620,1980 1980,2220 2220,2610
fetching that that same address|

1992
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,730
0,120 120,420 420,660 660,780 780,1290
and then both of them

1993
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:32,140
0,420 420,570 570,810 810,930 930,1350
flipping from 0 to 1,|

1994
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,270
0,540 540,1230 1230,1470 1470,1590 1590,1770
so I'm assuming that there's

1995
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:35,800
0,150 150,660 660,750 750,810 810,1530
some support from the hardware?|

1996
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,420
0,360 360,510 510,690 690,1170 1170,1500
Yeah, so like I mentioned

1997
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,680
0,60 60,180 180,630 630,750 750,1260
a bit earlier,| the primary

1998
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,150
0,210 210,300 300,870 870,1080 1080,1470
when it acquires,| the primaries

1999
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:42,010
0,270 270,810 810,1170 1170,1470 1530,1860
actually involved correct in the

2000
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:45,160
0,420 420,1110 1500,2490 2640,3150 3150,3150
primary on { -},| {so,the}

2001
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,110
0,720 720,1200 1200,1380 1380,1620 1620,1950
coordinator sends {},| so in

2002
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,460
0,90 90,360 360,870 900,1140 1140,1350
the lock step like this,

2003
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,950
0,180 180,870 1110,1470 1470,1920 2130,2490
this step step one,| the

2004
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:52,990
0,570 570,930 930,1470 1470,1800 1800,2040
primary order coordinator sends an

2005
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:56,710
0,780 810,1260 1260,1860 1860,2610 2820,3720
{} write RDMA to the

2006
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:58,660
0,120 120,240 240,870 900,1470 1470,1590
to the primaries,| asking the

2007
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,940
0,480 480,630 630,1200 1410,2160
primaries to lock the

2008
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:04,710
0,600 600,1230 1740,2490 2580,3150 3180,3720
{} object| and the primaries

2009
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:06,420
0,480 480,1230 1260,1470 1470,1650 1650,1710
answer explicitly {} with a

2010
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:09,270
0,510 540,810 810,1410 1800,2460 2460,2850
message, that reply,| and so

2011
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,280
0,390 390,810 810,1350 1350,1530 1530,1980
this crucial step that happens

2012
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,390
0,300 300,450 450,540 540,930 930,1110
is,| that the primary when

2013
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:13,170
0,120 120,300 300,570 570,660 660,780
it actually tries to get

2014
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:14,850
0,90 90,510 840,990 990,1170 1170,1680
the lock| and that lock

2015
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:17,010
0,720 720,930 930,1350 1380,1590 1590,1980
{} is set,| you know

2016
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,270
0,390 390,570 570,690 690,960 960,1260
reason this is one single

2017
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:19,920
0,480 480,660 660,1230 1350,1530 1530,1650
64 bit number,| is so

2018
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,460
0,120 120,240 240,330 330,480 480,540
that you can use []

2019
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,110
0,240 240,330 330,510 510,1170 1320,1650
test and set instruction which

2020
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:23,640
0,90 90,720 960,1170 1170,1290 1290,1530
is atomic {} to set

0,90 90,540
the lock.|

0,360 360,600 600,1080 1650,2160 2160,2310
So if two, {} so

2023
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:29,780
0,750 750,1020 1020,1110 1110,1470 1470,1830
there's never the case,| there's

2024
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,580
0,300 300,510 510,780 780,1500 1500,1800
only if two {test,and,set} instructions

2025
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,410
0,180 180,1080 1080,1170 1170,1380 1380,1830
run exactly the same time,|

2026
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,370
0,240 240,330 330,450 450,510 510,870
one is going to win,

2027
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:34,910
0,120 120,240 240,330 330,450 450,510
the other is going to

2028
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:35,560
0,480
lose.|

2029
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,570
0,180 180,390 390,660 660,900 1590,2070
I see, thank you.| That's

2030
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:40,220
0,60 60,450 450,900 930,1350
a crucial point, right.|

2031
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:44,900
0,330 330,510 510,660 660,1860 1890,2550
I've got a question about

2032
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:46,680
0,210 210,540 540,930 930,1380
the blue commit point.|

Yeah. {}|

2034
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:52,100
0,390 390,690 690,1200 1440,1950 2310,2880
Wouldn't it, so.| {Should,I}, {let,me},

2035
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,120
0,210 210,420 420,540 540,840 840,1020
{} maybe it's better to

2036
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,890
0,720 720,1320 1320,1350 1350,1500 1500,1770
actually open a new slide

0,120 120,240 240,480 480,840 840,1020
with the picture again| and

2038
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:58,220
0,300 1260,1560 1560,1620 1620,2130 2130,2310
just instead of scribbling even

2039
01:08:58,220 --> 01:08:59,240
0,270 270,450 450,810
more over this,|

2040
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:00,540
0,120 120,510 510,720 720,870 870,1050
I mean, let's get one

2041
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:01,680
0,180 180,570 570,690 690,810 810,1140
more picture,| so we can

2042
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:03,740
0,270 270,450 450,630 630,1380
talk about other scenarios,|

2043

0,120 120,270 270,300 300,480 480,630
I think a little bit

2044
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:16,760
0,480 660,900 900,1410 1410,1710 1710,1890
bigger,| I think should do

2045
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:17,640
0,390
[that].|

2046
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:20,720
0,510 540,990 990,1290 1290,2010

2047

0,420 420,990 1020,1320 1320,1800 2670,2940
worried about,| {let,me} see.| {Yeah,the}

2048
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,750
0,270 270,480 480,870 870,1440 1470,1890
commit point between step, after

2049
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:27,520
0,210 210,420 420,990 990,1320 1320,1770
step 3, before step 3.|

2050
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:29,500
0,300 300,420 420,1440 1470,1770 1770,1830
Yeah, so here, here's the

2051
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,900
0,480 480,870 870,1260 1740,2250 2250,2400
decision, correct.| Right.| {Starting,to,commit} and

2052
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,220
0,480 780,1290 1290,1650 1650,2040
then basically here's the

2053
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,520
0,870 870,1290 1320,1740
{actually,commit} point, right.|

2054
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:39,220
0,600 630,1380 1440,1740 1740,1860 1860,2130
Okay, {} yeah I guess

2055
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,360
0,120 120,540 540,840 840,930 930,1140
I was trying to think

2056
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,140
0,240 240,330 330,780 780,1470
about the scenario,| where,

2057
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:44,710
0,390 390,510 510,660 660,1680 1710,2130
would it be possible for

2058
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:47,440
0,90 90,690 690,1350 1350,1770 1770,2730
a completely separate concurrent transaction,|

2059
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:50,410
0,240 240,510 510,1020 1020,2250 2430,2580
that writes only p3 to

2060
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:52,120
0,180 180,450 450,840 840,1410 1440,1710
get {interleaved - -},| {to,like}

2061
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:54,610
0,510 510,660 660,1380 1980,2190 2190,2460
start and complete in that

2062
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:55,540
0,780
space,|

2063
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,220
0,150 150,300 300,630 630,1050
and then wasn't that?|

2064
01:09:57,450 --> 01:09:59,970
0,450 450,720 720,1620 2040,2280 2280,2520
No, [],| yeah yeah we're

2065
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:01,590
0,450 450,630 630,990 990,1320 1320,1620
problematic, but can't, correct,| because

2066
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:02,490
0,150 150,330 330,570 570,630 630,900
when it writes, it doesn't

2067
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:03,270
0,150 150,240 240,510 510,600 600,780
get the lock at some

2068
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:03,920
0,390
point,|

2069
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:05,750
0,510 510,840 840,960 960,1080 1080,1170
and when we get the

2070
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,620
0,210 210,300 300,510 510,570 570,870
lock, we check the version

2071
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:07,580
0,270 270,390 390,480 480,750 750,960
number and the lock bit.|

2072
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,200
0,210 210,390 390,1110 1200,1440 1440,1620
Does the read, does the

2073
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,520
0,240 240,360 360,810 810,1230 1230,1320
read the p3 affect the

2074
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,630
0,270 270,540 540,630 630,870 870,1110
version number and lock it?|

2075
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,490
0,270 270,630 630,780 780,960 960,1200
No, no, it just gets

2076
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:17,740
0,330 330,600 600,960
the version number.|

2077
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:22,410
0,210 210,1440 2130,2310 2310,2790 2790,3060
But if you, let let

2078
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:23,610
0,120 120,480 480,630 630,960 960,1200
me hold that question,| you're

2079
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:24,180
0,120 120,180 180,270 270,510 510,570
going to come back at

2080
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:24,800
0,390
this.|

2081
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:26,660
0,390 390,630 630,750 750,1020 1020,1410
Okay, then we'll see what

2082
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:27,660
0,240 240,810
actually happens?|

2083
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:29,820
0,330 330,750
Okay, thanks.|

2084
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,900
0,210 210,390 390,990
Any other questions?|

2085
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:35,710
0,270 270,420 420,510 510,690 690,780
This might be like a

2086
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:37,150
0,360 360,780 780,870 870,1020 1020,1440
separate scenario,| but what happens

2087
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:40,030
0,990 1380,1800 1980,2130 2130,2430 2460,2880
if {} you know after

2088
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:41,640
0,90 90,780 780,1380
the execution phase,|

2089
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,780
0,720 780,960 960,1230 1230,1380 1380,1800
{} you know it tries

2090
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:45,400
0,90 90,630 630,840 840,1380 1410,1620
to acquire a lock| and

2091
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,530
0,150 150,690 690,870 870,1440 1590,2130
then crashes right {after,that}, {}|

2092
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,120
0,150 150,420 420,660 660,810 810,1320
{and,the} lock has been acquired,|

2093
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:49,990
0,120 120,210 210,360 360,600 600,870
but no one else after

2094
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:51,100
0,210 210,330 330,690 690,840
that can acquire it.|

2095
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:53,270
0,690 690,960 960,1110 1110,1260 1260,1440
Yeah, okay so well first

2096
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:54,680
0,60 60,150 150,270 270,810 840,1410
of all the machine disappears

2097
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,060
0,180 180,270 270,570 570,1050 1050,1380
from the earth, correct| and

2098
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,320
0,300 300,660 660,720 720,990 990,1260
memory content is gone too,|

2099
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,180
0,690 690,1320 1320,1620 1620,1680 1680,1980
and, {} in the whole

2100
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:03,280
0,660 690,1290 1290,1560 1560,1680 1680,2100
recovery protocol that is described

2101
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,060
0,60 60,150 150,390 390,720 720,780
in the next section in

2102
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,520
0,90 90,570 600,870 870,1110
the paper kicks in,|

2103
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,680
0,780 780,1200 1200,1470 1470,1860 1860,1920
and, {} that protocol in

2104
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,150
0,120 120,360 360,870 870,1350 1350,1470
the end will abort the

2105
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:10,040
0,540
transaction,|

2106
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,050
0,210 210,630 630,960 960,1140 1140,1410
so it will get cleaned

2107
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:19,660
0,330
up.|

2108
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:23,960
0,120

2109
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,630
0,330 330,630 630,1230 1260,1740 1800,2190
Just another question,| {} so

2110
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:30,970
0,330 330,570 570,690 690,1740 2130,2340
here like the coordinator is

2111
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:32,320
0,120 120,660 660,960 960,1110 1110,1350
the client, right, like it's

2112
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,250
0,210 210,870 870,2100 2100,3480 3690,3930
the application.| Yeah yeah.| And

2113
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,660
0,210 210,360 360,810 810,960 960,1410
so the client is basically

2114
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,980
0,360 360,600 600,690 690,1140 1140,1320
doing all the steps,| of

2115
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:41,650
0,270 300,840 870,1410 1650,2460 2460,2670
like log that.| Yeah, yeah,

2116
01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:42,850
0,420 420,780 780,870 870,1020 1020,1200
so you could think about

2117
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:43,870
0,120 120,630 630,900 900,960 960,1020
the applications running on the

2118
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:45,340
0,330 330,570 570,660 660,930 930,1470
same set of 90 machines,

2119
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,230
0,360 360,930 930,1500 1500,1590 1590,1830
right,| {} and you know

2120
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:49,450
0,330 330,480 480,1140 1320,1590 1590,2220
running this transaction which apparently

2121
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:50,500
0,60 60,240 240,540 540,690 690,1050
you know writes two objects

2122
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,140
0,150 150,270 270,720 1020,2220 2250,2640
of each one| and runs

2123
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:53,820
0,120 120,600
the protocol.|

2124
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,880
0,450 480,1020 1110,1710 1830,1950 1950,2340
And so, {} I guess

2125
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:58,770
0,240 240,630 630,1050 1230,1500 1500,1740
what's confusing is,| so does

2126
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:00,600
0,120 120,630 630,1140 1140,1710 1710,1830
the primary not communicate with

2127
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,760
0,90 90,660 660,1470 1620,1920 1920,2160
the backup directly, it's the.|

2128
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:04,830
0,660 660,840 840,1140 1140,1560 1590,2040
No, it's actually indeed {},|

2129
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:05,970
0,120 120,390 390,570 570,750 750,1140
the primary does not directly

2130
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:07,220
0,450 450,540 540,600 600,960
communicate with the backup.|

2131
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,660
0,600
{I,see}.|

2132
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:11,630
0,360 360,480 480,750 750,1260 1260,1650
Other than during recovery protocol,|

2133
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:12,680
0,210 210,300 300,480 480,540 540,1050
there's all kinds of communication

2134
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:13,760
0,360 360,450 450,630 630,810 810,1080
happening,| but that's not shown

2135
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,360
0,300
here.|

2136
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:20,180
0,210 210,450 450,1110 1110,1350 1350,1590
So the coordinator just uses

2137
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:21,950
0,120 120,1050 1050,1410 1410,1530 1530,1770
the configuration from the {zookeeper

2138
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:24,590
0,390 390,900 930,2100 2100,2310 2310,2640
-}.| Yeah yeah, you go

2139
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,610
0,240 240,330 330,510 510,750 750,1020
back to the very first

2140
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:27,770
0,480 930,1620 1620,1710 1710,2010 2010,2160
picture,| {} you know there's

2141
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:28,610
0,120 120,270 270,330 330,690 720,840
all kinds of stuff you

2142
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:29,690
0,180 180,510 510,570 570,720 720,1080
know related to this {to,that},|

2143
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:31,340
0,90 90,240 240,570 570,960 1260,1650
I'm not talking about {}

2144
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,660
0,240 240,390 390,750 750,1230 1230,1320
like this precise membership and

2145
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:33,320
0,120 120,210 210,360 360,420 420,660
all that kind of thing,|

2146
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:35,540
0,420 420,960 960,1320 1320,1770 1770,1890
but basically the zookeeper and

2147
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:37,430
0,360 360,810 810,1170 1170,1770 1770,1890
connection manager really decide,| well

all that stuff,|

0,90 90,270 270,510 510,960 960,1470
and in any failure happens,|

0,90 90,240 240,420 420,480 480,960
you know there's a whole

2155
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:50,680
0,600 600,900 900,1140 1140,1380 1410,1650

0,420 420,810
{I,see}, {thank,you}.|

2158
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:02,800
0,510 540,1170 1260,1680 1680,1830 1830,1980
Okay, {} maybe I'm gonna

2159
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,320

0,210 210,330 330,420 420,750 780,1320
and so I can go

2161
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,260
0,60 60,210 210,330 330,810 960,1620
a little bit further {},|

{the,question} you know I wanted

0,60 60,300 300,390 390,720 720,870
to answer the question,| that

2164
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:12,820
0,420 420,720 720,1140 1860,2010 2010,2130
{} in the that was

01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:13,900
0,360 360,660 690,960 960,1020 1020,1080
asking the post in the

2166
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:15,790
0,330 330,540 540,960 1320,1590 1590,1890
lecture,| I'm gonna lecture question

2167
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:16,570
0,180 180,450 450,570 570,720 720,780
and I'm just going to

2168
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:18,310
0,150 150,420 420,900 1080,1560 1560,1740
do that by talking about

2169
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,900
0,90 90,780 780,870 870,1350 1350,1590
an example of transaction| and

2170
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:20,650
0,180 180,420 420,600 600,690 690,750
this also comes to the

2171
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:22,570
0,390 390,690 690,1050 1440,1800 1800,1920
earlier question about,| {} you

2172
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:23,560
0,60 60,270 270,780 780,870 870,990
know what happens, you know

2173
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,600
0,150 150,660 660,1140 1320,1830 1830,2040
two transactions run and read

2174
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,070
0,210 210,840 840,1140 1140,1350 1350,1470
one version| and then it

2175
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:29,320
0,510 570,1020 1020,1890 1890,2010 2010,2250
commits {blah,blah,blah} all this stuff,|

0,330 840,1350 1620,1770 1770,1890 1890,1950
so {} so this is

2177
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:32,620
0,420 420,540 540,810 810,1170 1170,1320
really the topic here| is

2178
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:33,280
0,120 120,180 180,300 300,450 450,660
going to do we get

2179
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,500
0,330 330,720 720,1140
strict {serializability -}.|

2180
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:40,520
0,240 240,360 360,480 480,660 660,900
And what I'm gonna do

2181
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,390
0,210 210,420 420,660 660,720 720,870
is,| I'm {not,going} to give

2182
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:42,290
0,90 90,180 180,690 720,780 780,900
you {} proof,| you know

0,210 210,420 420,660 660,1110 1110,1380
I'm getting {strict,serializability -} will

2184
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:44,510
0,90 90,450 450,570 570,690 690,840
be,| instead what I'm gonna

2185
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:45,140
0,150 150,300 300,360 360,480 480,630
do is,| I'm going to

2186
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:45,830
0,240 240,360 360,510 510,570 570,690
walk for one or two

2187
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:46,960
0,690
examples,|

2188
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,210
0,480 480,600 600,780 780,990 990,1110
{} to get build up

2189
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:49,240
0,150 150,690
some intuition,|

2190
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,790
0,150 150,450 450,540 540,1230 1230,1290
and hopefully the intuition you

2191
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:51,930
0,150 150,360 360,420 420,780 780,1140
know sort of convinced you

2192
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:53,130
0,180 180,390 420,810 810,990 990,1200
know that things might actually

2193
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:53,900
0,90 90,390
be fine.|

2194
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:55,720
0,360 360,660 660,1230 1230,1290 1290,1350
So let's look at the

2195
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,190
0,210 210,960 1020,1140 1140,1290 1290,1470
{following,transaction -},| we have {TxnBegin

2196
01:13:57,190 --> 01:13:58,380
0,240 240,750
- -},|

2197
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:00,790
0,180 180,300 300,780 780,960 960,1050
and this transaction is,| you

2198
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:02,560
0,330 360,1020 1020,1140 1140,1200 1200,1770
know like in the beginning,

2199
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:04,240
0,210 210,390 390,480 480,1080
it reads an object

2200
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:09,880
0,270 270,780
adds 1,|

2201
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:14,580
0,180 180,390 390,960
and then write

2202
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:19,540
0,750
{the,object}

2203
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,500
0,450 450,1080 1110,1590 1620,2160
and commits or ends

2204
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,760
0,270 270,510 510,1170
with commit {by,fail},|

2205
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:27,460
0,150 150,360 360,420 420,1110
so that's a transaction.|

2206
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:29,340
0,690 990,1170 1170,1290 1290,1410 1410,1530
And you know we want

2207
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,170
0,660 660,1080 1080,1560 1560,1740 1740,1830
to ask yourself,| what are

2208
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:32,790
0,210 210,570 570,1050 1050,1500 1500,1620
the legal outcomes,| what are

the {outcomes -} correct.|

2211

0,240 240,390 390,480 480,570 570,870
what could be the state

2214
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,540

0,300 300,360 360,450 450,870 870,1290
what are the possible outcomes

2219
01:14:58,820 --> 01:14:59,740

0,210 210,510 510,600 600,780 780,1470
you're using it with pessimistic

2358
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:05,740
0,120 120,360 360,750 750,1080 1080,1680

2361
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:08,650
0,60 60,180 180,480 480,810 1140,1380

0,210 210,270 270,360 360,480 480,990

0,510 510,1020 1020,1140 1140,1260 1260,1560

01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,610
0,150 150,270 270,450 450,690 690,1170

0,420 450,690 690,930 930,1980 2610,2760
So {read-only -} transactions,| so

2367
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:17,340

0,210 210,300 300,780 780,930 930,1140
what's the performance, how good

2371
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:27,170
0,120 120,420 450,630 630,870 870,1110

01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,410
0,420 660,1080 1080,1380 1380,1620 1620,1890
{} Probably pretty well, since

0,600 600,1050 1050,1140 1140,1260 1260,1440
Yeah, correct, if you look

2376
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:37,570
0,90 90,210 210,570 570,690 690,780

0,120 120,210 210,330 330,660 660,810
which is the object that's

2379
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:43,270
0,210 210,600 750,990 990,1410 1410,1560

0,120 120,600 600,750 750,990 990,1320
that happens is {one-sided -}

01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:50,090
0,150 150,360 360,660 660,1200 1200,1740

01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:04,350
0,360 360,780 810,1110 1110,1470 1470,1680
because the read operation don't

2387
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:05,640
0,420 420,870 870,1020 1020,1230 1230,1290

0,90 90,270 270,360 360,600 600,690
that needs to happen is

2390
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:10,260
0,450 450,750 750,1200 1230,1530 1530,1770
{this,validation -} step,| which also

2391
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:11,820
0,90 90,150 150,600 600,1290
is {} one-sided RDMA,|

2392
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:13,190
0,360 360,570 570,810 810,1140 1140,1200
so {read-only -} transaction, you

2393
01:20:13,190 --> 01:20:14,120
0,150 150,300 300,600 600,750 750,930
can just run with two

2394
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,800
0,240 240,570 570,1260
{one-sided -} RDMAs,|

2395
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,860
0,600 600,990 990,1470 1470,1620 1620,1680
{} and that's where the

2396
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:20,260
0,240 240,390 390,690 690,990 1560,2400
big one comes from| and

2397
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:21,400
0,90 90,420 420,750 750,1050 1050,1140
the reason that point is

2398
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,420
0,270 270,390 390,660 660,810 810,1020
there is,| because of the

2399
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:24,040

0,150 150,210 210,420 420,810 810,930
So I think basically to

2401
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:26,770
0,720 720,870 870,1230 1230,1350 1350,1440

0,60 60,360 360,540 540,720 720,900
to make a {read-only -}

2404
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:33,880

0,240 240,510 510,720 720,1020 1020,1650
they got went to optimistic

0,450 450,600 600,930 930,1020 1020,1440
Okay, I see, I see,

2408
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:41,900
0,330 330,810 1020,1440 1440,1710 1710,1830
makes sense,| another question was

2409
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:44,360
0,630 630,1710 1740,2250

2410
01:20:44,850 --> 01:20:45,960
0,300 300,540 540,750 750,990 990,1110
this thing is gonna be

2411
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,360
0,450 450,660 660,1140

2412
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:48,460
0,630

2413
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:50,330
0,150 150,390 390,780 960,1290 1290,1560
I guess if someone already

2414
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:51,680
0,210 210,420 420,570 570,960

2415
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:53,830
0,450 450,810 810,1290 1290,1650 1650,2010

2419
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:02,620
0,120 120,330 330,390 390,1080 1080,1470

0,240 240,420 420,870 900,1470 1530,2100
So like is, or.| No,

2443
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,230
0,630 630,780 780,1020 1020,1140 1140,1230
correct,| what happens if you

2445
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:47,780
0,180 180,270 270,390 390,750 750,1050
this in this particular case,

2446
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:48,340
0,420
correct.|

2447
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:52,240
0,1260 1830,2370
Yeah, {}

2448
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:53,370
0,180 180,270 270,360 360,360 360,510
if we have a lot

2449
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:54,480

0,210 210,390 390,480 480,1110 1110,1200
So this is really you

2452
01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:00,010
0,120 120,390 390,570 570,1140 1140,1500

0,210 210,420 420,630 630,720 720,1170
So what's like the main,

2460
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:15,840

0,120 120,240 240,450 450,1170 1170,1440

0,240 240,360 360,450 450,1080 1080,1290

0,480 870,1350 1350,1830 1830,2460 2490,2730

0,390 390,660 660,900 900,1050 1050,1110
correct, you poll them in

2547
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,560
0,240 240,660 660,750 750,1170 1230,1320

0,210 210,270 270,510 510,600 600,810

0,30 30,210 210,330 330,480 480,870
I think what you're referring

2570
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:38,040
0,180 180,360 360,600 600,750 750,1260

0,270 270,450 450,540 540,810 810,1260

0,240 240,450 480,780 780,900 900,960
correct,| like let's look at

2574
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,060
0,150 150,480 480,990
this picture here,|

0,510 510,630 630,750 750,930 930,990
then you would have to

2576
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:45,600
0,240 240,390 390,660 660,750 750,1380
talk to lots of different

2578

{} and if you are

0,300 300,630 630,1350 1350,1500 1500,1800

0,540 630,750 750,930 930,1050 1050,1380

0,180 180,360 360,570 570,690 690,780
so you only have to

2587
01:26:00,690 --> 01:26:01,920
0,330 330,540 540,930 930,1170 1170,1230

01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,040
0,270 270,630 660,930 930,1200
I see, thank you.|

2590
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:14,660

0,510 510,1110 1170,1440 1440,1860 1860,1980
So this, so FaRM is

2592
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,050
0,270 270,450 450,960 960,1440 1470,1890
not really suitable for long

2593
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:26,220
0,1230 1350,1890 1920,2730 2970,3600 3750,4170

2594
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,560
0,450 450,660 660,1020 1020,1110 1110,1320
Yeah, you're worried {} long

2595
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,520
0,60 60,540 540,690 690,810 810,960
of transactions that you get

conflicts.|

2597
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:33,970
0,150 150,390 390,600 600,1230 1290,1680
I mean, it also is

2598
01:26:33,970 --> 01:26:36,190
0,720 720,810 810,1350 1620,2010 2010,2220

0,90 90,270 270,660 720,1200 1620,2640
for them, right.| Yeah, absolutely,|

2601
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:43,000
0,300 300,870 870,1200 1200,1410 1410,1590

2602
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,350
0,420 420,660 660,780 780,1140 1140,1350

2603
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:45,400
0,180 180,330 330,450 450,900 900,1050
saw in Spanner paper too,

2604
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,060
0,360
correct,|

2605
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:47,720
0,570 600,690 690,990 990,1380 1380,1470
where a large fraction of

0,60 60,150 150,630
of the workload.|

0,330 330,750 750,840 840,960 960,1260
going back to my earlier

2612
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:06,620
0,330 330,480 480,630 630,870 870,1710

0,240 240,510 510,1590 1650,2640 2640,2970
I was misunderstanding basic about

01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:16,160
0,600 1320,1980 1980,2370 2370,2580 2580,2790

2616
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,750
0,150 150,540 540,720 720,900 900,1590
so here's here's a situation,|

2617

0,120 120,240 240,540 600,930 930,1200

2622
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:32,290
0,180 180,600 600,990 1110,2610 2610,3390

0,810 1020,1320 1320,1590 1590,1980 1980,2250
And then say, there's this

2627
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:48,310
0,390 390,1350 1470,1710 1710,2130 2130,2880

0,270 270,510 510,630 630,870 870,1320
that tries to write z,|

2641
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,670
0,300 300,570 570,690 690,930 930,1170
{} and then say {T2

2642
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:19,260
0,300 300,840 840,1170 1170,1380 1380,1590
-} commits before {T1 -}

0,780 780,960 960,1080 1080,1230 1230,1620
Yes, okay, so this commits

2646
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:26,180
0,390
yep.|

2647
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,770
0,210 210,540 540,720 720,900 900,1170
And then {T1 -} commits

2648
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:29,360
0,300 300,780 810,1170 1170,1410 1410,1590
after T2 commits.| {We'll -}

2649
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,220
0,270 270,390 390,780 810,1290 1470,1860
try to commit, correct,| now,

2650
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:33,080
0,240 240,510 510,780 780,960 960,1860
we'll start doing this whole

2651
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:35,630
0,420 420,630 630,1410 1410,2130 2130,2550
lock, for validation {blah,blah,blah}, correct.|

2652
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:39,420
0,330 330,1140 1830,2370 2370,2490 2490,2670
So before before, so what's

2653
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:40,770
0,210 210,480 480,1020 1020,1140 1140,1350
gonna happen correct,| you know

2654
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:41,460
0,180 180,300 300,420 420,480 480,690
I was going to give

2655
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:42,780
0,150 150,300 300,900 960,1140 1140,1320
you this example,| {} this

2656
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:43,620
0,60 60,150 210,660 660,750 750,840
is an example that I'm

2657
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:44,760
0,300 300,420 420,600 600,930 930,1140
saying for next lecture,| but

2658
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,150
0,870 870,1230 1230,1350 1350,1830 1830,2310
yeah basically what happened C

2659
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:49,170
0,150 150,240 240,600 660,870 870,1020
would be good,| C will

2660
01:28:49,170 --> 01:28:50,220
0,390 390,780
get 1,|

2661
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:52,650
0,180 180,330 330,780 780,1230 1260,1680
at this point, the z

2662
01:28:52,650 --> 01:28:53,370
0,180 180,330 330,390 390,660 660,720
will be a version of

2663
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:55,410
0,240 240,660 1260,1470 1470,1530 1530,2040
1, correct,| so the validation

2664
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:56,400
0,270 270,420 420,630 630,930 930,990
phase will run after the

2665
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,540
0,330 330,540 540,630 630,780 780,1140
commit,| that's what you said.|

2666
01:28:57,990 --> 01:28:59,430
0,420 750,1020 1020,1110 1110,1410 1410,1440
Right.| And so here's a

2667
01:28:59,430 --> 01:29:00,820
0,570 570,660 660,1080
validation of z,|

2668
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:02,570
0,720 720,840 840,990 990,1200 1200,1350
and you know it has

2669
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,190
0,510 510,750 930,1350 1350,1470 1470,1620
0, right,| and now it's

2670
01:29:04,190 --> 01:29:06,050
0,390 390,720 720,1080 1080,1380 1410,1860
1 and will those transactions

2671
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,880
0,120 120,210 210,600 1080,1590 1590,1830
will be abort.| Okay, so

2672
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:08,420
0,150 150,240 240,360 360,420 420,540
this is what I was

2673
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:10,040
0,270 270,480 480,690 690,1170 1170,1620
wondering about that,| so because

2674
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:13,010
0,360 360,450 450,1080 1080,1800 1860,2910
after the validation phase passes,|

2675
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:13,820
0,180 180,270 270,330 330,600 600,660
there was a period of

2676
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:14,800
0,780
time,|

2677
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:18,740
0,390 390,450 450,1290 1590,2100 2100,2550
after the validation phase passes,

2678
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:19,580
0,120 120,330 330,390 390,540 540,840
a period of time passes,

2679
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:21,500
0,240 240,840 1020,1350 1350,1650 1650,1920
it commits,| what if this

2680
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,660
0,720 720,1200 1200,1770 1770,2010 2010,2160
validation happened before {T2 -}

2681
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:24,860
0,480 480,600 600,720 720,960 960,1200
committed,| so it's still sort

2682
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:26,700
0,60 60,540 750,1140 1140,1590
of old version number.|

2683
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:29,680
0,300 300,810 810,1050 1050,2130 2280,2730
It cannot happen,| because after

2684
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:33,700
0,840 840,2160 2460,2880 2880,3180 3630,4020
{the,validation}, {} after commit, after

2685
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:36,340
0,210 210,360 360,870 870,1290 1770,2640
commit has completed, correct,| the

2686
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,260
0,360 360,930 930,1140 1140,1350 1350,1860
commit backup {you,know} has recorded|

2687

0,90 90,150 150,600 600,930 930,1530
and the primary after []

2688
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:41,040
0,180 180,390 390,450 450,1080
have made the change,|

2689
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,240
0,870 870,1020 1020,1530 1530,1680 1680,2040
before the application was returned,|

0,240 240,420 420,840 840,1350 1350,1680
before the upcoming returns,| z

2691

0,840

2693
01:29:51,130 --> 01:29:52,300
0,510 570,720 720,720 720,1080 1080,1170
Wouldn't, {} I guess what

2694
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:53,290
0,90 90,300 300,450 450,780 780,990
I'm saying is,| isn't it

2695
01:29:53,290 --> 01:29:56,350
0,540 540,1080 1080,1710 1710,2610 2610,3060
possible {for,T1's -} validation phase

2696
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:59,020
0,120 120,840 840,1770 2100,2460 2550,2670
to happen before| or I

2697
01:29:59,020 --> 01:29:59,620
0,150 150,300 300,390 390,480 480,600
guess maybe what I'm trying

2698
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:00,610
0,60 60,270 270,570 570,840 840,990
to say is,| isn't it

2699
01:30:00,610 --> 01:30:02,920
0,480 480,750 750,1050 1050,1740 1740,2310
possible that {T2's -} commit

2700
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:05,800
0,480 480,1020 1020,1290 1290,1830 1830,2700
happens between {T1's -} validate,|

2701
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:07,930
0,120 120,450 450,930 930,1230 1230,1860
what happens after T1 validate

2702
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:10,300
0,660 660,1530 1530,1800 1800,2190
before {T1's -} commit.|

2703
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:13,260
0,990

2704
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:14,580
0,450 450,540 540,660 660,840 840,900
Clearly, you know there's a

2705
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:17,100
0,450 480,1380 1470,1800 1800,1920 1920,2520
risk and must be excluded,

2706
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:20,600
0,960 1410,2640

2707
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,250
0,360 390,720 720,1620 1620,2490 2490,2730
and is executed,| {} so

2708
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:25,780
0,210 210,360 360,600 600,1230
okay so you're worried,|

2709
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:27,480
0,180 180,510 510,840 840,930 930,1140
let me construct this case

2710
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:28,140
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,570 570,660
may well come back to

2711
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,190
0,180 180,420 420,630 630,840 840,1050
you in next week,| we're

2712
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:31,080
0,150 150,480 660,1230 1260,1710 1740,1890
gonna {talk,it} anyway,| {} but

2713
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:31,740
0,90 90,240 240,330 330,390 390,660
I think you are worried

2714
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:33,030
0,300 300,480 720,930 930,1140 1140,1290
about it,| you could get

2715
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:34,000
0,60 60,330 330,720
the picture back,|

2716
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:36,750
0,540 540,960 960,1410 1860,2100 2100,2640
{} you're here, we did,|

2717
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:38,220
0,1140

2718
01:30:38,530 --> 01:30:40,540
0,450 480,870 870,1710
so this guy

2719
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:43,510
0,690 960,1170 1170,1410 1410,1770 1770,1950
committed,| so you basically doing

2720
01:30:43,510 --> 01:30:44,710
0,90 90,360 360,750 750,1080 1080,1200
the commit phase,| this is

2721
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:45,840
0,180 180,660
{T1 -}

2722
01:30:46,830 --> 01:30:48,510
0,300 300,360 360,810 810,930 930,1680
after {} T2 who actually

2723
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:50,660
0,720 720,1290
{} T2,|

2724
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:52,850
0,480 480,660 660,930 930,1350 1350,1560
{} so {T2 -} is

2725
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:54,620
0,360 360,690 690,870 870,1470
about doing is here,

2726
01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:57,170
0,480 930,1380 1380,1590 1590,1920 1920,2040
right,| then {T1 -} is

2727
01:30:57,170 --> 01:31:01,400
0,270 270,780 1020,2190 2250,3810 3930,4230
coming in before {} everything

2728
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,500
0,690 720,1170 1170,1320 1320,1710 1710,2100
happens,| before the T2 {is,finished,correct}.|

2729
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:05,380
0,600
Right.|

2730
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:07,520
0,330 330,630 630,870 870,1110 1110,1710
So like {T1 -} validation

2731
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,530
0,240 240,450 450,570 570,960 1590,2010
also comes in here,| so

2732
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:10,820
0,450 450,570 570,780 780,930 930,1290
maybe,| okay, let me rewrite

2733
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:11,540
0,180 180,270 270,420 420,510 510,720
it,| and I'll get back

2734
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:14,300
0,90 90,210 210,1650 2130,2610 2610,2760
to you.| Okay.| Exactly what

2735
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:15,350
0,270 300,540 540,600 600,780 780,1050
I wanted to talk about.|

2736
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:18,380
0,120 120,780 780,1020 1020,1200 2490,2730
All right, thank you.| So

2737
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:19,610
0,210 210,390 390,630 630,870 870,1230
just make sure, you're asking

2738
01:31:19,610 --> 01:31:20,960
0,300 300,480 480,780 780,1020 1020,1350
about {T2 -} being like

2739
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:22,640
0,210 210,750 750,1110 1110,1290 1290,1410
in between stage two and

2740
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,760
0,330 330,420 420,660 660,2010
three of T1.| Yeah.|

2741
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,170
0,180 180,270 270,540 540,990 990,1290
But in that case,| then

2742
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:29,670
0,240 240,870 930,1080 1080,1410 1410,1500
{T2 -} we could, we

2743
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:31,170
0,150 150,840 840,1020 1020,1290 1290,1500
could serialize it as {T2

2744
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:33,690
0,150 150,570 570,1380 1410,1860 2130,2520
-} coming {for,T1}, right,| Yep.|

2745
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:37,260
0,180 180,990 990,1260 1260,1500 1500,1710
So, let's, let's get, let's

2746
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:38,430
0,120 120,330 330,390 390,600 600,1170
get back to this on

2747
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:40,050
0,450 900,1020 1020,1200 1200,1260 1260,1620
Thursday,| I have an example

2748
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:41,640
0,390 390,780 780,1380 1380,1530 1530,1590
{for,that} exactly was going to

2749
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:42,600
0,150 150,300 300,480 480,630 630,960
go over top of this.|

2750
01:31:46,330 --> 01:31:47,980
0,510 510,600 600,660 660,1260 1260,1650
Sorry in the validation stage,|

2751
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:51,130
0,120 120,420 600,1500 1590,2310 2790,3150
you just read, {} read

2752
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:53,200
0,270 270,750 750,1410
the version number.|

2753
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:54,320
0,270 270,660
Yeah.| Okay.|

2754
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,160
0,300 300,930 930,1380 1380,1800 1800,1980
And {serializability -} allows us

2755
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:02,260
0,150 150,540 540,1740 1770,1980 1980,2100
to reorder transactions.| Yeah, but

2756
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,910
0,450 450,660 660,870 870,1200 1200,1650
{strict,serializability -} will not, correct,|

2757
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,550
0,390 390,870 870,1650 1680,2160 2160,2490
even if transaction structure []

2758
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:07,810
0,240 240,750 750,930 930,1110 1110,1260
or requires that even transaction

2759
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:09,400
0,210 210,660 660,780 780,1260 1260,1590

2760
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,020
0,300 300,780 930,1110 1110,1530 1530,1620
somebody committed,| that transaction is

2761
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:12,550
0,210 210,540 540,870 870,1020 1020,1530
also committed after that transaction.|

2762
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,700
0,360 360,960 990,1290 1290,1380 1380,1500
Right.| {} Which is {protocol

2763
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:16,750
0,90 90,300 300,720 720,930 930,1050
- -} guarantee,| because of

2764
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:17,500
0,420
the,

2765
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:18,920
0,150 150,420 420,810
the version numbers.|

2766
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:21,180
0,330 330,450 450,660 660,960
Got it, thank you.|

2767
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:24,420
0,180 180,510 510,1290 1320,2130
But strict serializability doesn't,|

2768
01:32:24,650 --> 01:32:25,700
0,210 210,270 270,390 390,660 660,1050
if I give {T2 -}

2769
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:26,640
0,660
and

2770
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,350
0,180 180,390 390,720 720,1080 1080,1350
it's not enough for {T1

2771
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:30,030
0,510 510,690 690,930 930,1380 1380,1680
-} the end after {T2

2772
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:32,060
0,690 1050,1800
-} ends,|

2773
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,570
0,210 210,360 360,810 810,1110 1110,1170
{T1 -} have had to

2774
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:35,700
0,240 240,1020 1050,1380 1680,2070 2070,2130
have started| or maybe I

2775
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:36,510
0,120 120,180 180,300 300,480 480,810
need to think about this,|

2776
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:38,070
0,300 540,750 750,1290 1290,1470 1470,1560
but I think this is

2777
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,970
0,210 210,450 450,570 570,720 720,900
always tripping me up,| this

2778
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,890
0,180 180,360 360,720 720,1560 1590,1920
like there's also a rule

2779
01:32:40,890 --> 01:32:42,600
0,270 270,660 660,750 750,1290 1290,1710
about when the transaction starts.|

2780
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,490
0,450 450,750 750,900 900,1410 1500,1890
Yeah, well, they're very well

2781
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:45,870
0,240 240,510 510,630 630,810 810,1110
what happens in real life,|

2782
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:47,580
0,960 960,1200 1200,1290 1290,1410 1410,1710
exactly starts from some particular

2783
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:48,990
0,180 180,240 240,600 600,840 960,1410
point of time| and basically

2784
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:50,900
0,660 690,1740
if T1,

2785
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,830
0,330 330,540 540,900 900,1350 1350,1590
{} if T2 starts after

2786
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:54,180
0,420 420,1110
T1 commits.|

2787
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:57,900
0,360 450,690 690,780 780,1230 1350,1650
Right.| So and so then

2788
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:58,830
0,150 150,450 450,540 540,630 630,930
it must be the case,|

2789
01:32:58,830 --> 01:33:01,080
0,240 240,600 600,1470 1650,1800 1800,2250
that T2 observes {you,know} {T2

2790
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,120
0,360 360,750 750,1440 1470,1680 1680,2040
-} T1 changes that {strict,serializability

2791
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,120
0,750
-}.|

2792
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:05,520
0,540
Right.|

2793
01:33:05,790 --> 01:33:07,380
0,150 150,270 270,690 690,1170 1170,1590
But what happened {T2 -}

2794
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:09,930
0,510 510,750 750,1200 1200,1710 1710,2550
starts and commits solely within.|

2795
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:11,850
0,240 540,780 780,1290 1290,1440 1440,1680
{Then,concurrent -} transaction and either

2796
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:17,730
0,270 270,360 360,720 1020,1530 1740,5880
outcome is fine.| Okay.| {Is,that,answer,your,question}.|

2797
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:20,700
0,330 330,1470 1680,2160 2160,2310 2310,2970
{Yeah,I,think,that,I,confused}, so.| Exactly, they literally

2798
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:23,400
0,540 600,1050 1050,1200 1200,1680 1680,2430
when {T2 -} starts before

2799
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,170
0,180 180,420 420,1050 1170,1410 1410,1770
{T1 -} commits,| it's considered

2800
01:33:25,170 --> 01:33:26,360
0,120 120,450 450,990
the concurrent transaction,|

2801
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,550
0,450 450,690 690,900 900,1200 1200,1350
and so {T1 -} or

2802
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:30,050
0,270 270,570 600,930 930,1050 1050,1500
you know T2 can observe

2803
01:33:30,050 --> 01:33:31,610
0,330 330,600 600,750 750,1080 1080,1560
either can be ordered before

2804
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:33,530
0,210 210,510 570,840 840,1170 1380,1920
either after,| doesn't matter.| Okay,

2805
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:34,340
0,480
okay.|

2806
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:36,040
0,450 660,900 900,1020 1020,1080 1080,1230
Okay, thank you.| I think

2807
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:37,000
0,240 240,510 510,630 630,870 870,960
there's also the answer to

2808
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
0,330 330,930 1170,1860 2190,2670 2730,3000
your example.| Right, okay, thank

2809
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,770
0,240 270,960 960,1110 1110,1590 1590,1770
you.| {Okay,we} have we got

2810
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:44,710
0,60 60,330 330,750 2460,2730 2730,2940
it anyway already.| You'd say

2811
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:46,570
0,420 600,840 840,1050 1050,1560 1560,1860

0,270 270,600 600,810 810,1140 1140,1350
can we go for or

01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:54,340
0,240 240,330 330,510 510,870

2816
