0,60 60,480 480,570 570,1410 1410,1800

0,300 300,690 780,1590 1710,2010 2010,2250
and so by putting things

0,480 480,900 900,960 960,1230 1230,1680
now look at them| or

237
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,020
0,90 90,240 240,390 390,840 840,960
the way we recognize,| they

0,300 300,660 660,1080 1080,1230 1230,1500
probably started around the same

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,230
0,270 270,570 570,840 840,1110 1110,1710

early 80s.|

243

0,450 450,630 630,750 750,840 840,1170
{} And so for example

00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,480
0,90 90,210 210,360 360,420 420,750
you would have a campus

connecting for example the workstations|

0,180 180,600 600,1380 1380,1740 1740,1860
like Athena clusters to the

0,90 90,240 240,300 300,870 870,1350

course you know Internet was

0,180 180,720 750,1170 1170,1290 1290,1380
there too,| {} but there

0,180 180,450 450,720 720,900 900,990
was really not sort of

257
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,980
0,870 870,1200 1200,1770 1770,1860 1860,2040

0,120 120,360 360,480 480,600 600,1050
them now| and so the

260
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,720
0,390 390,570 570,720 1170,1560 1560,1920

0,240 240,660 900,1110 1110,1470 1470,1980

0,240 240,360 360,570 570,960 1020,1440

265
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,960
0,120 120,180 180,420 420,630 630,780

00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,180
0,180 180,570 570,1170 1290,1440 1440,1530

0,330 330,450 450,750 750,870 870,960
able to search all the

299
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,130
0,660 660,810 810,1140 1140,1290 1290,1470
different web pages,| that actually

300
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,390
0,210 210,360 360,780 930,1170 1170,1260
were on the on the

301
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,430

0,390 540,690 690,1260 1290,2190 2190,2250
And so these applications you

304
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,690
0,150 150,420 420,900 900,1380 1380,1620
know gave rise to two

305
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,070
0,150 150,240 240,510 510,1050 1080,1380
sort of things,| one huge

306

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,060
0,180 180,270 270,660 660,870 870,960
have the index all the

309
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,260
0,180 180,540 540,660 660,750 750,1200

0,270 270,360 360,510 510,870 870,1200
{} so I mean like

311
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,890
0,420 420,900 900,1080 1080,1740 1740,2040
gather crawl all webpages,| then

312
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,840
0,450 450,810 810,1260 1260,1440 1440,1950
computer reverse index| and then

313
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,560
0,120 120,210 210,390 390,570 570,720
you could use that for

314
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,390
0,120 120,390 390,660 1350,1650 1680,1830
your search engine| and that

00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,380
0,120 120,270 270,330 330,810 810,990
was just a tremendous amount

316
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,400
0,60 60,390 420,540 540,840 840,1020
of data,| that didn't fit

317
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,600
0,60 60,300 300,750 810,1140 1140,1200
on one computer| and the

318
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,710
0,210 210,270 270,720 720,840 840,1110
amount of computation to actually

319
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,880
0,120 120,330 330,540 540,1050 1050,1170
do the first indexing| you

320
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,620
0,90 90,450 450,690 690,1110 1380,1740
know there's also too much

321
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,730
0,150 150,210 210,420 420,870 900,1110
for the same computer,| as

322
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,470
0,90 90,600 600,690 690,1170 1260,1740
a result you know data

323
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,850
0,300 300,480 480,1050 1050,1200 1200,1380
centers came about,| you know

324
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,560
0,360 360,810 1020,1410 1410,1620 1620,1710
companies started putting lots and

325
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,490
0,150 150,210 210,600 600,690 690,930
lots of computers and data

326
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,180
0,300 300,420 420,540 540,600 600,690
centers,| so that it can

327
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,860
0,420 420,600 600,810 810,900 900,1680
support those kinds of applications.|

328
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,010
0,180 180,330 330,660 660,930 930,990
So that's one lot of

329
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,330
0,450 660,840 840,900 900,1140 1140,1320
data| and the second one

330
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,290
0,90 90,240 240,300 300,870 870,960
is just a lot of

331
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,900
0,480 1320,1860 1860,2310 2310,2550 2550,2610

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,190
0,90 90,300 300,720 720,1140 1140,1290
know big upside websites have

333
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,540
0,330 330,420 420,720 720,810 810,1350
hundreds of millions of users,|

334

0,210 210,510 510,960 960,1020 1020,1200
and this requires a lot

335
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,120
0,60 60,450 450,540 540,1050 1050,1380
of machines to actually support

336
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,240
0,90 90,270 270,690
all those users.|

0,150 150,270 270,390 390,930 1020,1710
And so we see {}

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,260
0,540 540,780 780,870 870,1470 1500,2490

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,470
0,240 240,330 330,1020 1020,1560 1560,2340

of concurrent,|

508

0,180 180,540 540,1050 1050,1170 1170,1560
things happening concurrently,| it's very

511

0,330 330,420 420,720 720,900 900,1200
hard to reason that through,|

00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,850
0,540 540,1110 1110,1350 1350,1950 2190,2550

0,660 660,1140 1140,1650 1650,1770 1770,1890

0,180 180,240 240,720
things are correct.|

0,270 270,390 390,510 510,1410 1470,2190
And this is compounded by

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,680
0,90 90,420 420,750 750,960 960,1080
the fact that {distributed -}

0,90 90,360 360,750 750,960 960,1140
of these machines actually might

521
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,970
0,120 120,630 720,1200 1230,1350 1350,1470
go down,| {} but that

522

0,210 210,420 420,510 510,570 570,750
doesn't mean that the whole

523
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,160
0,510 510,930 930,1080 1080,1380 1380,1440
competition stops,| in fact you

524
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,970
0,390 390,450 450,660 660,750 750,810

0,300 300,780 780,1230 1230,1380 1380,1920
machines probably hopefully can continue

526
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,120
0,270 270,390 390,690 690,780 780,1230
running| and maybe you know

527
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,050
0,240 240,570 570,750 750,840 840,900
take over some of the

528
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,310
0,720 720,810 810,870 870,1140 1140,1260
responsibility of the machine that

529
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,200
0,450
failed.|

530

0,480 510,660 660,900 900,1560 1560,1650
{} But this drives you

531
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,780
0,180 180,510 510,690 690,930 930,1530
know these two things together,|

532
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,180
0,780 780,1170 1170,1830
basically drive complexity,|

0,240 240,540 540,900 900,990 990,1260
it becomes harder and harder

00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,360
0,120 120,660 690,1080 1080,1680 1680,1890
to reason about| why you

535
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,260
0,90 90,180 180,510 510,810 810,900

0,420
working.|

537
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,040
0,420 420,540 540,900 900,1140 1140,1470
{} And particularly partial failure

0,210 210,450 450,720 720,1410 1620,2100
makes things very complicated,| because

539
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,190
0,210 210,600 600,810 810,960 960,1050
one system one part of

0,60 60,360 360,540 540,840 840,990
the system might think that

541
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,140
0,270 270,450 450,510 510,600 600,960
another part of the system

542
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,730
0,120 120,630 720,1320 1320,1410 1410,1590
is down,| but it's not

543
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,690
0,180 180,240 240,660 660,840 840,960
really the case,| now the

544
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,560
0,240 240,360 360,480 480,630 630,870
only thing that might actually

545
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,370
0,300 300,420 420,570 570,750 750,810
happen is that,| there's a

546
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,770
0,330 330,780 1110,1920 1920,2100 2100,2400
network partition,| and so both

547
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,090
0,300 300,360 360,480 480,840 840,1320
sides of the distributed system,|

{you,know} basically keep on computing|

549
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,050
0,360 360,540 540,810 810,1290 1290,1530
{} and maybe interact with

550
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,480
0,210 210,840 840,1770 1830,2160 2160,2430
{you,know} clients,| {} maybe even

551
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,320
0,300 300,390 390,450 450,690 690,840
interact with the same set

552
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,250
0,60 60,390 390,600 600,660 660,930
of clients,| because the clients

553
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,540
0,90 90,330 330,540 540,900 900,1290
can talk to both parts,|

554
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,410
0,420 420,510 510,660 660,810 810,870
between the two and a

555
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,550
0,390 390,720 720,900 900,990 990,1140

0,300 900,1080 1080,1170 1170,1710 1710,2040
other| and so this, this

557
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,730
0,120 120,360 390,750 750,990 990,1140
is a problem known as

558
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,980
0,120 120,510 510,870 870,1470 1560,2250
the split brain syndrome| and

559
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,440
0,720 720,1110 1110,1200 1200,1440 1650,2400

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,970
0,150 150,510 510,990 990,1110 1110,1530
{distributed -} systems| and protocols

0,90 90,150 150,870 870,990 990,1590
{distributed -} systems are complicated

0,390 420,570 570,840 840,990 990,1050
So it's really sort of

564
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,000
0,840 840,1260 1260,1590 1590,1830 2310,2790
deeper intellectual problems here,| then

565
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,720
0,120 120,210 210,360 360,540 540,720

566
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,280
0,90 90,360 360,840 840,1290 1290,1560
of really aspect in terms

567
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,170
0,90 90,780 810,960 960,1170 1170,1890
of challenges,| it's actually tricky

0,300 300,390 390,870 870,960 960,1620
that in principle are possible

570
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,000
0,450 450,840 840,1410
with distributed systems.|

0,330 330,660 660,1050 1050,1140 1140,1530
So far we've been talking

572
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,020
0,420 420,510 510,630 630,690 690,930
like you want to increase

573
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,980
0,60 60,660 660,750 750,810 810,960
the capacity| or you want

574
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,120
0,60 60,180 180,570 570,690 690,1140
to run things in parallel,|

575
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,500
0,90 90,300 300,480 480,1020 1050,1380
you buy more machines or

576
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,760
0,210 210,420 420,660 660,870 870,1260
{you,know} buy another data center,|

577

0,810 810,1230 1230,1350 1350,1710 1710,2430
{} and you know of

578
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,720
0,240 240,690 690,870 870,930 930,1320
course only when the task

579
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,940
0,90 90,540 540,1080 1080,1710 1800,2220
is complete embarrassment parallel, {}|

580

0,150 150,360 360,720 750,1260 1260,1680
does that work and often

581
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,850
0,300 300,750 750,900 900,1050 1050,1230
in practice,| now there's just

582
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,600
0,180 180,240 240,510 510,630 630,750
not the case,| and so

583
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,950
0,300 300,870 870,1050 1050,1200 1200,1350
actually achieving that sort of

584
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,220
0,330 330,780 1080,1680 1710,2460 2460,2850
a high throughput| and throughput

585
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,180
0,480 480,600 600,690 690,900 900,960
scaling with the number of

0,600 660,1140 1140,1230 1230,1290 1290,1590
machines| turns out to be

587
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,570
0,330 360,750 750,1440 1440,1560 1560,1800
{} not straightforward at all.|

588
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,070
0,240 240,330 330,600 600,750 750,1230
Sort of brings me to

589
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,110
0,360 360,870 870,1140 1140,1470 1470,2040
hear {} next topic,| why

590
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,670
0,270 270,750 1050,1350 1350,1470 1470,1560
you takes {6.824 - -

591
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,590
0,540 570,810 810,1170 1410,1680 1680,1920
-}. { - - -}|

592
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,230
0,750 1110,1530 1530,1650 1650,1710 1710,1890
You know, so I think

593
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,390
0,240 240,570 570,1170 1230,1950 1950,2160
for four reasons,| one it's

594
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,700
0,600
interesting,|

595
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,300
0,300 300,540 540,840 840,1290 1320,1890
yeah, it's like hard technical

596
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,950
0,630 630,870 870,990 990,1260 1260,1650
problems,| and with very powerful

597
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,140
0,660
solutions.|

598
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,560
0,210 210,540 540,1320
So hard problems,

599
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,480
0,240 240,600 600,1200
but powerful solutions.|

600
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,370
0,240 240,630 630,810 810,1140 1140,1710
We'll see {you,know} those solutions,|

601
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,040
0,150 150,270 270,540 540,990
you know {for,the} term.|

602
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,660
0,330 330,570 570,810 810,1170 1170,1440
Second reason is {you,know} used

603
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,600
0,60 60,120 120,330 330,810
in the real world.|

604
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,470
0,210 210,390 390,510 510,840 840,1020
And there's a normal amount

605
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,670
0,60 60,780 780,870 870,1080 1080,1200
of appetite for people,| that

606
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,230
0,510 510,1080 1080,1230 1230,1320 1320,1560
actually understand and can build

607
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,840
0,390 390,990
distributed systems.|

608
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,350
0,120 120,270 270,390 390,480 480,510
{} If you were a

609
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,000
0,270 270,630 630,870 870,1380 1380,1650

0,210 210,780 810,1080 1080,1140 1140,1380
about research,| it's a great

611
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,520
0,390 420,690 690,810 810,870 870,1140
area,| because it's a very

612

0,90 90,210 210,450 450,690 690,930
there are still many open

614
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,450
0,810 1950,2400 2610,2730 2730,2880 2880,3000
problems| and as we go

615
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,730
0,150 150,210 210,720 720,1620 2070,2280
through the semester, you will

616
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,500
0,360 360,630 840,1320 1320,1470 1470,1770
encounter them,| so it's a

617
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,390
0,360 360,720 720,1110 1110,1530 1680,1890
good area for research.| And

0,420 420,630 630,750 750,900 900,1200
finally, if you like building

619
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,820
0,480 540,930 930,1050 1050,1170 1170,1230
things,| {} it's sort of

0,180 180,300 300,510 510,570 570,630
Let me pause for a

636
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:24,900
0,270 270,390 390,510 510,600 600,690
second here and see if

644
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,830

00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,210
0,330 330,450 450,720 720,1080 1110,1380
TAs will also be paying

646
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,830
0,420 420,660 660,1020 1020,1290 1290,1620
attention to the raising hands

647
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,360
0,240 240,720 750,1050 1050,1410 1410,1530
and the chat,| so in

648
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,440
0,270 270,330 330,540 540,990 990,1080
case I miss something| you

649
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,600
0,480 780,1050 1050,1380 1380,1590
know they'll remind me.|

650
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,270
0,180 180,510 510,630 630,1410 1500,1770
Any questions so far, everything

651
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,700
0,90 90,390 390,870
is [crystal] clear.|

652
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,100
0,630

653
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,920
0,60

654
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,490
0,360 360,1020 1080,1230 1230,1800 1800,2100
Oh, interpret the silence is

655
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,860
0,330 330,420 420,810 810,1320
things are crystal clear.|

656
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,000
0,150 150,300 300,630 630,780 780,810
So let me talk a

657
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,780
0,180 180,300 300,480 480,540 540,780
little bit about the course

658
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,980
0,630
structure,|

659
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,270
0,420 420,600 600,1020 1020,1080 1080,1350
after this sort of quick

660
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,180
0,780 810,1140 1140,1620 1620,2280
introduction to distributed systems.|

661
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,020
0,630

662
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,540
0,240 240,330 330,510 510,900 900,1080
So the course structure is

663
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,190
0,210 210,570 750,1020 1020,1140 1140,1650
as follows,| we have lectures

664
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,530
0,300 300,360 360,540 540,1050 1290,2190
like the one today,| basically

665
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,340
0,360 360,480 480,660 660,1290
focuses on big ideas.|

666
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,890
0,300 300,540 540,840 840,900 900,1230
{} The lectures are typically

667
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,450
0,270 270,750 750,870 870,1380 1380,1560
driven by a paper that

668
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,100
0,150 150,270 270,870
we all sign.|

669
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,310
0,330 330,480 480,810 810,1170 1170,1950
And these papers are {}

670
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,290
0,540 540,660 660,960 960,1320 1410,1620
often a case study,| a

671
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,520
0,480 480,660 660,960 960,1110 1110,1230
particular big idea that we're

672
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,160
0,690 690,1230 1260,1710
covering in lecture.|

673
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,230
0,630 630,870 870,1470 1500,1740 1740,2100
{} Can we, {} the

674
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,820
0,360 360,480 480,600 600,1140 1140,1560
papers are all published or

675
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,890
0,390 390,660 660,1230 1260,1680 1680,2070
posted on the schedule page|

676
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,710
0,1050 1560,1740 1740,2010 2010,2490 2490,2820
and for most papers, we

677
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,940
0,330 330,510 510,810 810,1170 1170,1230
ask you to answer a

678
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,410
0,570 720,900 900,1110 1110,1200 1200,1470
question as well as ask

679
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,480
0,60 60,540 660,1110 1440,1830 1830,2070
a question| and we'll try

680
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,070
0,510 510,810 810,990 990,1410 1410,1590
to cover those questions or

681
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,350
0,360 360,1260 1260,1470 1500,1980 2070,2280
answer during a lecture| and

682
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,820
0,330 420,570 570,1140 1140,1260 1260,1470
so it's important you know

683
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,600
0,210 210,270 270,330 330,570 570,660
part of the reason we

684
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,410
0,120 120,360 360,480 480,690 690,810
do that is,| because we'd

685
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,400
0,180 180,360 360,720 720,930 930,990
like you to read the

686
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,080
0,420 420,570 570,930 930,1560 1590,1680
paper in advance of the

687
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,490
0,540 780,1080 1080,1200 1200,1290 1290,1410
lecture,| so that we can

688
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,570
0,240 240,270 270,450 450,600 600,1080
go a little bit deeper

689
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,780
0,450 450,960
{into,these} papers.|

795
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,400
0,90 90,210 210,330 330,600 600,1170

810
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,420

0,210 210,300 300,600 600,960 960,1050
little bit stronger semantics than

0,300 300,480 480,690 690,900 900,1020

0,420 420,540 540,720 720,900 900,1080

0,150 150,450 450,510 510,930 930,1410
these three are basically storage,|

1111
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,720
0,150 150,270 270,570 570,1500 1530,2220

0,120 120,660 660,750 750,990 990,1200
and communication to actually have

1114
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,210
0,120 120,360 360,630 630,1080 1080,1200
these different pieces communicate with

00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,560
0,120 120,420 870,1080 1080,1170 1170,1350
each other| and so those

1116
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,180
0,120 120,210 210,570 570,1350 1350,1620
are the three basic things

1117
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,070
0,150 150,600 1020,1380 1380,1740 1740,1890
that sort of,| which we

1118
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,670
0,30 30,270 270,360 360,510 510,600
are able to see the

0,630 780,1020 1020,1230 1230,1410 1410,1740
systems| and what we're looking

1120
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,850
0,390 390,510 510,660 660,750 750,1440
for are sort of abstractions|

0,150 150,270 270,720 780,1290 1290,1410
that have been proven to

1122
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,090
0,150 150,450 450,1170 1290,1500 1500,1830
be very helpful in building

{distributed -} systems.|

0,150 150,240 240,720 720,960 960,1260
There are abstractions like a

1125
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,740
0,210 210,240 240,540 540,870 870,1440
like a remote procedure call

1126
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,630
0,360 360,540 540,780 780,1110 1110,1800
or like {mapreduce -} library|

1127
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,610
0,660 660,870 870,1200 1200,1590 1590,1920
or in a storage system

1128
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,960
0,180 180,240 240,390 390,720 720,1350

0,180 180,750 870,1050 1050,1470 1470,1860
And often you know often

1130
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,060
0,120 120,690 690,900 900,1230 1230,1350
our goal will be| to

1131
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,730
0,180 180,390 390,1290 1470,2100 2100,2670
make the abstractions distributed abstractions

0,180 180,420 420,690 690,1020 1020,1110

00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,340
0,240 240,420 420,510 510,1080 1080,1500
know sort of normal standard

0,540 540,1140 1140,1890 1890,2070 2070,2250
sequential abstractions,| {} you've made

0,360 360,540 540,660 660,750 750,1140
familiar with,| so for example

1136
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,870
0,120 120,300 300,330 330,660 660,1140
we build a storage system,|

1137
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,030
0,270 270,450 450,900 900,1350 1350,1740
we want our basically distributed

1138
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,140
0,330 330,630 630,840 840,870 870,1110
storage system more or less

1139
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,230
0,810 960,1710 1710,1950 1950,2340 2340,3090
behave like a single machine

00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,810
0,1080 1320,1680 1680,2040 2040,2400 2400,2580
sequential {} storage server,| like

00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,920
0,120 120,420 420,690 690,990 990,1110
your regular file system on

1142

0,120 120,690 1200,1830 1830,1920 1920,2070
your laptop,| except you know

1143
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:40,860
0,240 240,360 360,540 540,660 660,870
that you know, we hope

1144
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,670
0,120 120,180 180,420 420,690 690,810
that the storage system is

0,510 540,720 720,960 960,1590 1620,2100
more {} fault tolerance,| because

1146
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,390
0,150 150,450 450,1290 1320,1500 1500,1620
they use replication,| may be

1147
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,830
0,240 240,360 360,510 510,1170 1170,1440
much more high performance,| because

1148
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,060
0,120 120,270 270,510 510,690 690,1230
it has many many machines,|

1149
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,560
0,270 270,330 330,1080 1080,1170 1170,1260
like the behavior of the

1150
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,820
0,330 330,450 450,540 540,780 780,1260

0,390 390,930 930,1020 1020,1470 1470,1560
is similar,| the abstraction that

1152
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,670
0,60 60,360 360,660 660,810 810,1230
we're looking for is similar

1153
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,680
0,270 270,690 690,990 990,1200
to a single one.|

1154
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,060
0,270 270,390 390,480 480,1020 1020,1260
Turns out in practice actually

1155
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,260
0,90 90,360 360,630 630,690 690,1200
is very hard to achieve,|

1156

0,600 600,660 660,870 870,1110 1110,1320
and you will see that|

0,210 210,390 390,600 600,780 780,900
it looks like it but

1158
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,730
0,90 90,300 300,810 840,1440 1440,1800
it's not exactly| and this

1159
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,990
0,120 120,180 180,510 510,690 690,1260
is a topic that will

1160
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,660
0,900 900,1050 1050,1410 1410,1980
show up multiple times.|

1161

0,300 300,600 600,690 690,780 780,930
In fact, you know that

1162
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,700
0,330 330,480 480,600 600,780 780,870
brings me to sort of

1163
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,400
0,240 240,360 360,1140
like the main

1164
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,830
0,330 360,1200 1200,1920 1980,2220 2220,2400
{} recurring themes {} in

1165

0,330 510,1140
this class,|

00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,210
0,270 270,660 660,930 930,1320 1320,1440
that we're {going,to,see} over and

1167
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,260
0,660
over.|

1168
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,610
0,270 270,360 360,510 510,870 870,1380
And the main topics are

1169
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,640
0,180 180,840
fault tolerance.|

1170
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,760
0,240 240,990
Not surprising.|

1171
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:31,900
0,180 180,270 270,450 450,600 600,750
And that has sort of

1172
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,750
0,510 510,1260 1410,2250 2250,2460 2460,2850
two aspects,| {} it's actually

1173
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,590
0,120 120,420 420,510 510,720 720,840
to define a little bit

1174
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,120
0,210 210,390 390,750 750,1020 1020,1530
what fault tolerance means,| one

1175
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,780
0,600 630,1530 2280,2790 2790,3180 3180,3480
is availability,| so we're looking

1176
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,280
0,330 330,1020
at techniques,|

1177
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,380
0,180 180,330 330,420 420,660 660,780
we're gonna be looking at

1178
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,100
0,450 450,1020 1260,1890 2790,3330 3360,3720
techniques to {} make a

1179
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,750
0,360 360,600 600,1140 1170,1470 1470,1650
systems highly available| and so

1180
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,800
0,390 390,480 480,690 690,780 780,1050
{} and what we mean

1181
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,570
0,300 300,480 480,690 690,1410 1530,1770
that is that,| they, they

1182
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,310
0,360 360,510 510,1080 1080,1260 1260,1740
continue to deliver their service

1183
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,980
0,690 690,1140 1140,1380 1380,1980 2370,2670
despite there being failures| and

1184
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,150
0,150 150,330 330,390 390,690 690,1170
so this is often expressed

1185
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,260
0,240 240,450 450,690 690,750 750,1110
as a number of nine,|

1186
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,690

0,750 750,1110 1110,1260 1260,1710 1710,1860
{} and so that's gonna

1188
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,740
0,450 810,1200 1200,1650 1650,1710 1710,1890

0,180 180,480 480,750 750,990 1110,1440
lot about these we're going

1192
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,140
0,60 60,270 270,600 600,1170
to call {recoverability -},|

1193

or fails,| {} we like

1195
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,730
0,480 480,870 900,1140 1140,1260 1260,1680
to {} bring it back

1196
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,110
0,300 300,390 390,780 780,1020 1020,1380

00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,730
0,90 90,210 210,420 420,540 540,630
we can keep up the

1199
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,440
0,660 690,960 960,1110 1110,1440 1440,1710

1200
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,120
0,420 420,510 510,1020 1110,1350 1350,1680
repair the system,| then basically

1201
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,080
0,120 120,210 210,570 570,720 720,960
all the machines would die

1202
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,670
0,420 420,570 570,1110 1200,1500 1500,1590
one by one until we

1203
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,810
0,90 90,450 450,870 870,960 960,1140
have zero machines| and then

1204
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,800
0,90 90,180 180,300 300,630 630,990
we have no service anymore,|

1205
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,000
0,120 120,240 240,750 750,930 930,1200
so it's important that we

1206
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,190
0,810 810,930 930,1320 1320,1800 1950,2160

0,180 180,330 330,630 630,690 690,780
way we repaired to the

00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,260
0,270 270,600 600,690 690,1140 1140,1290
distributed system is basically when

1209
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,520
0,60 60,420 420,600 600,870 870,1260
the machine comes back up,|

1210
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,560
0,270 270,450 450,870 1320,1800 1800,1890
now we're gonna needs to

1211
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,880
0,360 360,480 480,1020 1020,1140 1140,1320
recover its state| and then

1212
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,960
0,60 60,180 180,270 270,480 480,1080
we're going to start participating

1213
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,400
0,330 330,600 600,810 810,1050 1050,1440
back into the distributed systems|

1214
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,750
0,90 90,180 180,420 420,720 1050,1350
and it turns out {}

1215
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,030
0,330 330,720 720,1170 1230,1890 1980,2280
there's actually hard,| {} that's

1216
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,120
0,60 60,270 270,870
a hard aspect.|

1217
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,760
0,420 930,1140 1140,1350 1350,2010 2010,2160
And a key technique for

1218
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,780
0,630 630,720 720,840 840,900 900,1020

0,60 60,840
{} replication.|

1220
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,360
0,240 240,360 360,960 960,1080 1080,1560
And the key {} technique

1221
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,530
0,750 750,900 900,990 990,1110 1110,1170
yeah that we're going to

1222
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,290
0,210 210,750 750,1530 1560,1920 1920,2760

1223
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,640
0,180 180,450 450,570 600,1230 1230,1350

1225
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,340

0,180 180,480 480,660 660,1140 1200,1350
So that neither one the

1227
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,430
0,300 300,480 480,780 780,870 870,930
power goes out,| but the

0,240 240,420 420,660 660,780 780,1470
machine comes back up afterwards,|

1229
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,320
0,90 90,810 840,1860 2190,2340 2370,3420
you were have the data

1230
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,760

1231
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,170
0,150 150,420 420,840 900,1110 1110,1470
So that's the fault tolerance

1232
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,140
0,420
side.|

1233
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,620

0,360 360,600 600,750 750,960 960,1770

0,120 120,180 180,510 510,660 660,1320
with the machines that crash,|

1567
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,740
0,180 180,270 270,750 750,990 990,1470
so the application writer itself,|

1568
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,000
0,330 330,780 780,960 960,1020 1020,1260

0,90 90,180 180,510 510,750 750,870
to be concerned about this

1571
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,140
0,120 120,420
at all.|

1572
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,700
0,330 330,540 540,840 840,1020 1020,1200
And they basically get all

1573
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,960
0,120 120,570 660,960 960,1140 1140,1260
that stuff,| {} if you

0,360 360,510 510,990 990,1080 1080,1260
{} And again to make

1576
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,350
0,120 120,660 720,810 810,930 930,1260
that happen,| you know the

0,180 180,240 240,600 600,690 690,870
so for example you wanted

1579
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,100
0,60 60,240 240,270 270,420 420,720
to write a key value

{mapreduce -} library,| because it's

1582
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,660

0,360 360,690 690,1080 1080,1200 1200,1290
and your application has to

1584
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,870
0,180 180,300 300,570 1110,1290 1290,1770

0,60 60,240 240,540 540,660 660,810
you know something that they

1587
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,290
0,300 300,420 420,810 810,870 870,1140

00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:10,200
0,60 60,540 630,990 990,1260 1260,1530
to do {} big data

0,210 210,240 240,510 510,750 750,810
There are many types of

00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,040
0,630 630,780 780,930 930,1110 1110,1170
computations that just have to

1594
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,500
0,480 480,1020 1020,1080 1080,1530 1770,2460

0,270 270,450 450,570 570,660 660,780
So that's sort of the

1598
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:24,130
0,240 240,330 330,960 960,1500 1620,2220

0,60 60,750 780,1560 1590,1680 1680,2220
of context| and the motivation

0,600 780,1140 1140,1290 1290,1950
Okay, let me proceed.|

1604
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,090
0,360 360,840 1290,1560 1560,1770 1770,1890
{} So, {} let me

1605
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:47,750
0,210 210,360 360,480 480,600 600,660
first draw a sort of

1606
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,100
0,90 90,660 660,1050 1050,1140 1140,1350
an abstract view of what's

1607
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,300
0,240 240,570
going on.|

1608
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,760
0,840

1609
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,630
0,240 240,630 630,750 750,990 990,1170
And then we'll dive into

1610
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,800
0,180 180,630
more detail.|

1611

0,240 240,720 840,1290 1500,1680 1680,2010
Yeah, so, {} so you,

1612
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:01,840
0,120 120,270 270,390 390,660 660,750
you sort of need to

1613
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,800
0,360 360,570 570,840 840,900 900,960
have in {} in the

1615
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,840
0,120 120,270 270,540 540,840 840,1200
how {mapreduce -} work,| which

1616
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,350
0,60 60,180 180,240 240,330 330,510
is going to be very

1617
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:09,520
0,360 360,480 480,900 900,1080 1080,1170
important for you when you're

1618
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,200
0,180 180,390 390,690 1170,1350 1350,1680
doing lab one,| is there's

1619
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,310
0,60 60,240 240,300 300,570 570,1110
a bunch of input files|

1620
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,170

0,120 120,270 270,360 360,480 480,540
Of course, there're going to

1623
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,740
0,60 60,270 270,510 510,840 840,960
be many, many more in

1624
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,270
0,300 300,720 720,960 960,1350 1350,1530
Google's case,| yeah but just

1625
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:22,220
0,240 240,870 870,1290 1290,1560 1560,1950
for pedagogical reasons,| you're gonna

1626
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:25,580
0,600 810,1890 1890,1980 1980,2280 2580,3330
and site of the size

1627
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,380
0,90 90,510 510,1020 1020,1500 1500,1800
of my display,| I just

1628
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,020
0,420 420,660 660,1200
have three files.|

1629
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:31,320
0,570 630,1230 1230,1650 1650,1860 1860,2010

1630
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,290
0,240 240,810 1260,2070 2070,2640 2640,2970

{} you know similar you

1663
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,350
0,150 150,390 420,1020 1350,1650 1650,1920
know the function map function

1664
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,760
0,660 690,870 870,960 960,1170 1170,1410
for does the same thing

1665
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,050
0,360 360,480 480,810 810,960 960,1290
for the file {f2 -}|

1666
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:35,890
0,150 150,300 300,570 570,690 690,840
and will produce some key

1667
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:37,270
0,390 390,480 480,660 660,930 930,1380
values| and let's say maybe

1668
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:38,470
0,210 210,600 600,690 690,900 900,1200
there's only the word b

1669
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:39,980
0,360 360,450 450,570 570,1050
appears in the file

1670
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,840
0,420 420,1020
{} once.|

1671
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:42,970
0,150 150,450 450,600 600,780 780,930
And maybe you know {f3

1672
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,790
0,510 630,1500 1620,1890 1890,1890 2460,2820
-}, { -} the map

1673
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,020
0,300 300,570 570,780 780,930 930,1230
function also runs into file

1674
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,020
0,150 150,600 990,1710 1920,2310 2310,3000
{f3 -}| and let's assume,

1675
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,610
0,150 150,390 390,660 660,1080 1110,1590
let's just where the phrases

1676
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:52,840
0,360 360,690 690,810 810,1110 1110,1230
assume that a shows up

1677
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,420
0,630 900,1590 1590,1800 1800,2100 2100,2580
once| and {you,know} word c

1678
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,840
0,300 300,390 390,840
shows up once.|

1679
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,610
0,210 210,960 960,1140 1140,1320 1320,1830
So basically {you,know,these} map functions

1680
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,010
0,240 240,510 510,1260 1350,1980 1980,2400
all running parallel,| completely independent

1681
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:02,910
0,90 90,210 210,570 570,660 660,900
of each other,| and there's

1682
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:04,860
0,330 330,840 840,1140 1140,1530 1560,1950
no communication between them on

1683
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,510
0,120 120,420 420,990 1350,1530 1530,1650
their input files,| so this

1684
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:07,200
0,60 60,180 180,240 240,420 420,690
is going to give us

1685
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:08,970
0,450 450,660 660,1260 1290,1620 1620,1740
hopefully high throughput| or you

1686
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:10,980
0,330 330,630 630,1170 1170,1380 1380,2010
know anxious scaled much much

1687
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,840
0,360 360,600 600,990 1470,1740 1740,1860
bigger data sets| and they

1688
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,700
0,390 390,510 510,690 690,1200 1200,1860
produced on these intermediate values|

1689
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,230
0,330 330,480 480,660 660,990 990,1500
{} these key value pairs

1690
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,210
0,120 120,390 390,510 510,1020 1020,1350
{a,,1 -} {b,, -} {you,know,b,,1

1691
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:19,260
0,210 210,600 600,750 750,810 810,1050
-} alone or {a,,1 -}

1692
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,080
0,180 180,420
c,1 too.|

1693
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,380
0,150 150,450 450,570 570,780 780,1110
And then, so the second

1694
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,330
0,630 930,1200 1200,1530 1530,1830 1830,1950
step is often referred to

1695
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:26,130
0,210 210,810 1020,1320 1320,1590 1590,1800
as shuffle,| {} is that

1696
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:29,310
0,540 540,1020 1020,2070 2310,2610 2610,3180
basically {you,know,run} reduce {} functions

1697
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,320
0,390 390,780 780,990 990,1530

1698
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,640
0,270 270,630 630,750 750,1110 1140,1320
So here we got the

1699
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,400
0,390 390,570 570,690 690,1230
row all the as.|

1700
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,810
0,450 450,540 540,660 660,720 720,1350
And we're going to run

1701
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,280
0,330 330,480 480,810 810,1350
{ -} reduce function,|

1702
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:41,090
0,150 150,270 270,330 330,660 660,1260
and then the reduce function

1703
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,800
0,420 420,930 930,1080 1080,1380 1380,1710
basically takes you know the

1704
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,750
0,270 270,840 870,1530 1530,1740 1740,1950
one key| aggregates all the

1705
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,420
0,510 510,810 810,1050 1050,1560 1560,1650
reduce function gets input,| the

1706
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,280
0,330 330,660 660,750 750,1290 1290,1860
key plus the aggregated values|

1707
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,970
0,150 150,450 450,1140 1140,1380 3150,3690
or not aggravate the,| combined

1708
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,290
0,570 570,690 690,870 870,1170 1170,1320
values you know from the

1709
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:55,610
0,300 300,630 630,720 720,1200 1200,1320
different outputs of maps,| so

1710
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:56,990
0,90 90,240 240,720 990,1260 1260,1380
in this case {} the

1711
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:58,160
0,270 270,660 660,840 840,1080 1080,1170
reduce function would get you

1712
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,920
0,150 150,840 990,1500 1500,2010 2010,2760
know two intermediate results,| both

1713
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,630
0,60 60,690 720,1020 1020,1530 1530,1710
on a with a and

1714
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:03,860
0,180 180,630 630,870 870,990 990,1230
two values one and one.|

1715
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,740
0,360 360,450 450,600 600,870 870,1260
And in this case in

1716
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,000
0,60 60,300 300,390 390,720 720,1260
the case of {the,word} count,|

1717
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:07,750
0,90 90,240 240,390 390,480 480,750
we just add them up|

1718
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,800
0,180 180,450 450,540 540,720 720,1020
and so you know it

1719
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,450
0,150 150,450 450,510 510,1110 1530,1650
would produce the value,| you

1720
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:12,040
0,360 390,780 780,1110 1110,1440 1440,1590
know key value pair {a,,2

00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,020
0,450
-}.|

1722
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,230
0,510 900,1110 1110,1350 1350,1800 1800,1920
And we do basically we're

1723
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:16,400
0,390 390,690 690,960 960,1110 1110,1170
doing| and basically what we're

1724
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,770
0,420 420,570 570,930 930,2010 2040,2370
doing we're doing we're going

1725
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:20,210
0,60 60,360 360,480 480,960 1290,1440
to reduce for every you

1726
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:21,700
0,360 420,990
know row,|

1727
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,130
0,270 270,510 510,750 750,900 900,1620
and so this will produce

1728
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,800
0,480 480,1230 1440,1710 1710,1950 1950,2640
whatever b,2| and then simply

1729
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,480
0,240 240,600 840,1080 1080,1530 1530,1680

1730
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,620
0,60 60,300 300,570
the last one.|

1731
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,030
0,270 270,780 810,990 990,1170 1170,1680
And again, you know the

1732
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,010
0,420 420,630 630,840 840,1080 1110,1830
once we've done to shuffle,|

1733
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:35,420
0,180 180,630 630,960 960,1080 1080,1410
these reduce functions can totally

1734
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,680
0,240 240,750 750,870 870,990 990,1260
run independent with each other,|

1735
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,570
0,240 240,390 390,510 510,870 1320,1860
{you,know} they can just process

1736
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,460
0,510 510,720 720,1260 1260,1440 1440,1890
whatever row data,| they have

1737
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,260

0,240 690,870 870,990 990,1140 1140,1500
it,| and so the only

1739
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,650
0,180 180,270 270,480 480,1590 1590,1890
sort of really expensive piece,|

1740
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,390
0,90 90,390 390,780 780,1260 1260,1740
and this is this shuffle

1741
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:50,150

0,150 150,480 480,1080 1920,2490 2490,3090
the reduce functions need to

1743
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:56,020
0,930 1020,1140 1140,1260 1260,1440 1440,1590

{} so when all the

1746
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,070
0,330 330,390 390,750 750,840 840,930
mappers are done,| you know

0,120 120,420 420,780 780,1470 1500,2130
the reduce function basically gets

1748
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,240
0,120 120,870 900,1230 1230,1530 1560,2040
you know needs to contact

00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,870
0,510 510,840 930,1740 1770,2310 2670,3630
every {} mapper,| {} extract

0,60 60,360 360,900 930,1380 1380,2430
you know the output for

1751
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:11,140
0,90 90,420 420,540 540,600 600,810
the output from the map

1752
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,700
0,150 150,330 330,690 690,990 990,1560
of that particular reduce function|

1753
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,100
0,870 930,1350 1350,1440 1440,1530 1530,2040
and {} you know sort

1754
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,180
0,90 90,210 210,420 420,930 930,1080
you know by p| and

1755
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,320
0,360 360,450 450,840 840,1050 1050,1140
then {you,know} basically run the

0,270 270,630
reduce function.|

0,210 210,420 420,840 840,1110 1110,1260
And so basically we're sort

1758
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:22,180
0,60 60,510 510,990 990,1890 1890,2250
of assuming that as paper

1759
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,890
0,240 240,600 630,810 810,1170 1170,1710
points out,| the expensive operation

1760
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:25,660
0,90 90,570 690,1230 1230,1320 1350,1770
is really {} the shuffling

1761
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,710
0,90 90,420 420,720 720,780 780,1050
of data between the mapper

1762
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:28,080
0,240 240,690
and reducer.|

1763
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,290
0,180 180,510 510,660 660,810 810,1650
Any questions about this abstract

1764
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:34,080
0,600
picture?|

1765
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:40,650
0,450 1020,1530 1560,1650 1650,1800 1800,1860
Oh, sorry I have a

1766
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:43,800
0,600 1050,2130
question,| so,

1767
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,110
0,240 240,720 720,1020 1020,1230 1230,1530
is there I know that

1768
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,430
0,270 270,420 420,840 840,1050 1050,1320
not all problems can be

1769
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,560
0,780 780,1350 1350,1500 1500,1770 1770,2130
expressed,| with in {mapreduce -}

1770
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,150
0,480 480,1200 1200,1260 1260,1410 1410,1590
stage,| but it is for

1771
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,520
0,990 990,1170 1470,1680 1680,2250 2250,2370
example {} like sorting an

1772
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,460
0,780 960,1200 1200,1620 1620,2250 2250,2940
array,| is it possible to.|

1773
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,350
0,720 810,1080 1080,1200 1200,1590 1590,1680
Yeah yeah, so sorting is

1774
00:55:58,350 --> 00:55:59,370
0,180 180,240 240,330 330,870 870,1020
one of the applications that

1775
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:00,930
0,750 780,960 960,1020 1020,1290 1290,1560
they talk a lot actually

1776
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,190
0,60 60,120 120,600 630,1140 1140,1260
in the paper,| and it

1777
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:04,080
0,150 150,420 420,1050 1050,1650 1650,1890
would be {} it's something

1778
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,130
0,210 240,540 540,750 750,870 870,1050
that's totally done with {mapreduce

1779
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:06,540
0,330 330,540 540,960 960,1080 1080,1410
-},| so basically you split

1780
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:07,860
0,330 330,780 780,1050 1050,1110 1110,1320
input files correct in many

1781
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,730
0,390 390,840 870,1230 1230,3390 3420,3870
things,| the mappers {} sort

1782
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:12,780
0,210 210,840
their piece,|

1783
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,670
0,210 210,810 810,810 810,1440 1440,1830
and then, {} they split

1784
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,230
0,210 210,630 630,1020 1020,1350 1350,1560
the output,| say like r

1785
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:18,750
0,600 870,1380 1380,1620 1620,2040 2040,2520
buckets| and then introduce functions,

1786
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,610
0,480 480,780 780,960 960,1440 1440,1860
basically sort that particular bucket.|

1787
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,410
0,360 360,540 540,600 600,900 900,1110
That gives a total sort

1788
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:23,460
0,90 90,510
of file.|

1789
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,120
0,210 210,360 360,810
I see, okay.|

1790
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,110
0,180 180,240 240,390 390,690 690,1020
And in this case, in

1791
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:30,610
0,300 300,390 390,780 780,1050 1050,1500
short is interesting,| because basically

1792
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:34,060
0,90 90,750 1140,1500 1500,2370 2490,3450
the input, the intermediate values

1793
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,920
0,180 180,270 270,750 750,1770 1800,1860
and the output are the

1794
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,420
0,240 240,780 1110,1200 1200,1350 1350,1500
same size| and some other

1795
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,650
0,450 450,660 660,960 960,1020 1020,1230
functions like maybe the map

1796
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:40,960
0,300 300,480 480,1200 1470,1710 1710,2310
function will reduce {} intermediate

1797
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,880
0,420 420,960 990,1380 1380,1590 1590,1920
state| to something much smaller

1798
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,440
0,180 180,270 270,570 570,1050 1230,1560
than the input size, {}|

1799
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,390
0,510 510,690 690,1500 1500,1800 1800,1950
{in,the,case} of {} sort that

1800
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,520
0,90 90,270 270,330 330,780
is not the case.|

1801
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:51,150
0,300 300,930 930,1080 1080,1170 1170,1380
Okay, let's look at the

1802
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,080
0,240 240,540 540,750 750,900 900,930
paper,| actually {you,know} get a

1803
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:52,950
0,150 150,270 270,360 360,660 660,870
little bit of sense,| actually

1804
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:54,930
0,150 150,330 330,600 600,900 1260,1980
how you write them. {}|

1805
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,730
0,750 930,1200 1200,1320 1320,1380 1380,1500
Well, see if I can

1806
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:00,680
0,510
actually.|

1807
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,500
0,210 210,360 360,960
That's just annoying.|

1808
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,400
0,330 330,390 390,960
Lost my menu.|

1809
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,110
0,420 420,570 570,840 840,1080 1080,1650
It's {} hold one second.|

1810
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:24,060
0,270 270,1020 1380,1740 1740,1890 1890,2010
Yeah, okay, it's not so

1811
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,470
0,450 450,630 630,780 780,1050 1050,1410
cool,| give me second to,

1812
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,480
0,390 420,600 600,690 690,990
{} here we go.|

1813
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,280
0,360 360,450 450,600 600,870 1050,1740
{} So we go save.|

1814
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:32,650
0,270 270,450 450,540 540,870 1380,2040
Good, here, we go, yeah.|

1815
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,300
0,990 1020,1200 1200,1500 1500,1650 1650,2040
Okay, can everybody see this?|

1816
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,060
0,210 210,360 360,450 450,660 660,1410
Okay, there's a couple questions,|

1817
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:44,520
0,870
{}

1818
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,020
0,270 270,540 540,990 990,1170 1170,1230
leg me postpone some of

1819
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,360
0,120 120,630 630,1350 1350,2010 2040,2340
these questions,| {for,example} {} see

1820
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,920
0,90 90,990 1020,1140 1140,1440 1440,1560
{them -} will discuss in

1821
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,820
0,60 60,330 330,390 390,510 510,900
a second in more detail,|

1822
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,620
0,180 180,420 420,1230 1260,1620 1620,1860
{} if I don't answer

1823
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,120
0,120 120,930 930,1200 1200,1440 1440,1500
your question, please ask it

1824
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:56,980
0,270
again.|

1825
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:57,550
0,90 90,180 180,360 360,510 510,570
So the first thing I

1826
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:58,150
0,120 120,180 180,300 300,390 390,600
want to do is actually|

1827
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:58,990
0,210 210,360 420,690 690,780 780,840
look at one of the

1828
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,310
0,420 420,510 510,570 570,1140 1140,1320
examples in the paper of

1829
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,540
0,60 60,300 300,480 480,750 750,1230
the map and reduce functions|

1830
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,280
0,480 480,690 690,960 960,1200 1200,1500
responding to the word count

1831
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,180
0,420 420,540 540,630 630,720 720,900
example,| that would be sort

1832
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,940
0,60 60,690 690,1290
of abstractly discussed.|

1833
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:08,580
0,210 210,510 510,690 690,1320 2220,2550
So here's the code for

1834
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,740
0,60 60,300 300,780 780,1410 1620,2160
the map, reduce function, {}|

1835
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:11,430
0,150 150,270 270,390 390,480 480,690
you see that the map

1836
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:14,460
0,360 360,750 750,1920 2130,2400 2400,3030
function takes {} key value,|

1837
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:15,870
0,240 240,540 540,630 630,990 990,1200
the key is really not

1838
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:16,890
0,90 90,540 540,780 780,900 900,1020
been important here,| it's the

1839
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,420
0,450 450,720 720,960 960,1170 1170,1530
document name,| so {f1 -}

1840
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,250
0,150 150,270 270,720 930,1260 1260,1830
or {f2 -} and string,|

1841
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,990
0,480 510,960 960,1290 1290,1380 1380,1740
the {value,is} basically the content

1842
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,000
0,90 90,180 180,600
of the file.|

1843
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,680
0,450 450,690 690,990 1020,1470 1470,1560
So all the words that

1844
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,420
0,270 270,690 690,990 990,1260 1260,1740

1845
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,160
0,150 150,450 1140,1290 1290,1350 1350,1740
{f1 -}| and it basically

1846
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,690
0,210 210,690 690,780 780,960 960,1530
goes through you know the

1847
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:31,310
0,510 510,720 720,1020 1020,1200 1200,1320
dispute piece code,| goes to

1848
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,270
0,390 390,480 480,780 780,870 870,960
improve the words and the

1849
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:34,010
0,540 750,1020 1020,1170 1170,1260 1260,1740
file| and as an intermediate

1850
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,690
0,510 510,1110 1110,1470 1470,1560 1560,1680
value, {} it's you know

1851
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,610
0,600 720,1170 1170,1170 1170,1710 1710,1920
these,| {} {a,,1 -} {b,,1

1852

-} c,1 etc.|

1853
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,700
0,240 240,330 330,450 450,870 870,1020
Look for the programmer point

1854
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,870
0,60 60,450 480,630 630,960 960,1170
of view,| you don't really

1855
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:43,880
0,180 180,450 450,1080 1500,1680 1680,2010
see these intermediate key value

1856
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,530
0,300 300,390 390,810 960,1470 1470,1650
pairs at all,| {} you

1857
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:46,700
0,150 150,360 360,480 480,780 780,1170
just write this one simple

1858
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,040
0,450 450,840
map function.|

1859
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,130
0,120 120,570 570,570 570,900 900,1170
And then, {} the reduce

1860
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:51,900
0,600 690,1080 1080,1350 1350,1620 1620,1770
function {} is also more

1861
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,950
0,0 0,300 300,870 870,930 930,1050
or less expected,| you know

1862
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:54,040
0,480
the,

1863
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,810
0,150 150,390 930,1140 1140,1650 1650,1770
it takes two arguments,| you

1864
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:56,830
0,120 120,240 240,720 720,870 870,1020
know the key you're like

1865
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,050
0,480 780,1260 1260,1920 1950,2040 2040,2190
a| and values in this

1866
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:00,310
0,330 330,600 600,810 810,1050 1050,1260
case {} word count would

1867
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:01,480
0,90 90,390 390,660 660,870 870,1170
be one one one one,|

1868
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,620
0,180 180,420 420,660 660,720 720,1140
which a number of times

1869
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,600
0,150 150,270 270,570 570,1230 1590,1980
that the {word,a} actually showed

1870
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,430
0,210 210,510 510,720 720,1320 1320,1830
up in the intermediate output.|

1871
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,420
0,120 120,420 420,630 630,1200 1230,1500
And basically what the function

1872
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,460
0,240 240,330 330,660 1350,1710 1710,2040
does,| it just goes over

1873
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,720
0,240 240,660 660,900 900,1020 1020,1260
to iterate over the list

1874
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,220
0,60 60,630 630,810 810,1290 1290,1500
of values| and basically add

1875
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,750
0,360 360,570 570,870 870,1080 1080,1350
one plus one plus one

1876
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,250
0,180 180,600 720,930 930,1080 1080,1500
plus one| and then it's

1877
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,300
0,90 90,180 180,300 300,570 570,1050
you know the final result.|

1878
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,650
0,630 690,840 840,1050 1050,1650 1650,1770
And so that's basically you

1879
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:21,700
0,300 300,480 480,570 570,840 840,1050
know you can see from

1880
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,870
0,180 180,600 630,930 930,1080 1080,1170
this code, right,| like the

1881
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:24,400
0,450 450,780 780,1110 1110,1470 1470,1530
programmer basically always right,| you

1882
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,340
0,120 120,720 720,1860 2010,2550 2550,2940
know complete straightforward sequential code,|

1883
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:30,160
0,270 270,930 960,1410 1410,1830 1830,2490
this application very simple, admittedly,|

1884
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,080
0,450 450,660 660,930 930,1440 1440,1740
{} but the code for

1885
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,370
0,180 180,360 360,690 690,1170 1170,1290
even more complex application would

1886
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:34,450
0,240 240,390 390,810 810,930 930,1080
also be straight,| you know,

1887
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:35,740
0,300 300,750 750,960 960,1080 1080,1290
the sequential might be more

1888
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:36,550
0,330 330,450 450,540 540,690 690,810
code,| but it would be

1889
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,640
0,540 540,960 960,1320
straightforward sequential code.|

1890
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,300
0,90 90,180 180,300 300,570 570,660
And in this code, the

1891
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,740
0,270 270,570 570,900 900,1200 1200,1440
program didn't really worry about

1892
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:41,580
0,60 60,240 240,420 420,720 720,840
the fact {that,at} all,| the

1893
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,990
0,360 360,540 540,1170 1200,1320 1320,1410
machines might crash,| you know

1894
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:44,490
0,150 150,330 330,420 420,840 840,1500
there might be loading balance,|

1895
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:45,990
0,240 240,600 600,960 960,1200 1200,1440
{} that's basically all taking

1896
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:46,890
0,210 210,300 300,360 360,570 570,900
care of the {mapreduce -}

1897
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:47,820
0,390
library.|

1898
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:50,130
0,360 360,660 660,900 900,1050 1050,1140
{So,as} and so you know

1899
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:51,210
0,90 90,570 570,750 750,900 900,1080
the hope and I think

1900
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:52,110
0,120 120,390 420,720 720,840 840,900
this has proven out to

1901
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:53,370
0,120 120,480 480,660 660,960 960,1260
be true,| is this actually

1902
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:54,420
0,330 330,450 450,750 750,840 840,1050
made with lots of lots

1903
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,950
0,90 90,360 360,480 480,870 1050,1530
of people to write distributed

1904
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:59,460
0,720 720,930 930,1620 1710,2970 2970,3510
applications| and process gigantic datasets|

1905
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:00,930
0,270 270,600 600,1020 1020,1230 1230,1470
and like {could,no} way fit

1906
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,300
0,150 150,240 240,510 510,900
on a single machine.|

1907
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,180
0,420 450,840 840,900 900,1110 1110,1320
Like {for,example}, the whole world

1908
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,280
0,180 180,570
wide web.|

1909
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:08,160
0,240 240,360 360,510 510,780 780,900
Does that make sense in

1910
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,440
0,270 270,630
terms of,|

1911
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:11,720
0,120 120,210 210,420 420,870 930,1410
you know what the programmer

1912
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,080
0,330 330,840
actually sees.|

1913
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,580
0,540 540,810 810,930 930,960 960,1140
Okay, let's talk a little

1914
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,920
0,120 120,330 330,720 750,1770
bit about the implementation.|

1915
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:20,480
0,750

1916
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,060
0,240 240,360 360,630 630,870 870,1320
So I'm using the diagram

1917
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,640
0,180 180,360 360,540 540,1020
here from the paper.|

1918
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,590
0,390 390,1350 1380,1770 1860,2100 2100,2250
So the, so we've got

1919
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:31,760
0,60 60,270 270,660 660,840 840,1170
the user program,| so the

1920
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,720
0,210 210,600 600,720 720,900 900,960
user program is like the

1921
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,890
0,240 240,330 330,420 420,750 750,1170
map and the reduce function

1922
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:35,930
0,150 150,300 300,480 480,960 1320,2040
that we just saw, {}|

1923
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,130
0,240 240,690 690,780 780,1020 1020,1200
you submit the map and

1924
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:40,130
0,330 330,720 720,1380 1440,2190 2250,3000
reduce function to {} the,|

1925
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:41,990
0,510 510,960 960,1140 1140,1260 1260,1410
{} you link it with

1926
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:43,400
0,180 180,450 450,720 720,1290 1290,1410
the {mapreduce -} library| and

1927
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,410
0,330 330,630 630,1290 1620,1830 1830,2010
then forms binary| and then

1928
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:46,790
0,210 210,420 420,570 570,810 810,1380
you give this to the

1929
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:49,580
0,660 660,960 960,1500 1500,1980 2160,2670
Google job scheduler| and {}

1930
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,560
0,210 210,570 570,1290 1290,1680 1710,1980
it will basically {} find

1931
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,610
0,60 60,180 180,330 330,390 390,1050
a whole bunch of machines|

1932
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,680
0,420 420,870 870,1470 1500,1680 1680,1860
{} and run {} what

1933
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,220
0,120 120,360 360,900 900,1230
they call workers there.|

1934
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,920
0,210 210,600 600,690 690,1080 1530,2580
So like you know {scheduler

1935
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,410
0,540 570,1260 1260,1350 1350,1710 1890,2490
-} {for,example} in the evaluation

1936
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:01,950
0,150 150,270 270,420 420,510 510,540
as we'll see in a

1937
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:02,670
0,390 390,450 450,540 540,690 690,720
second,| you know there are

1938
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:04,980
0,450 450,660 660,930 930,1530 1680,2310
about {1800 -} machines,| on

1939
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,060
0,180 180,390 390,570 570,990 990,1080
these {1800 -} machines, you

1940
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:07,260
0,120 120,390 390,720 720,900 900,1200
know the scheduler will run

1941
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,390
0,150 150,450 450,1050 1200,1650 1650,2130
{} worker process,| that actually

1942
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:11,310
0,600 660,1020 1020,1140 1140,1500 1500,1920
{} does the actual work|

1943
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:12,840
0,240 240,780 780,930 930,1380 1380,1530
and evokes {you,know} map and

1944
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,880
0,330 330,960 990,1350 1350,1740 1740,2040
reduce functions {} when when

1945
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,120
0,240 240,810
when appropriate.|

1946
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:18,590
0,300 300,510 510,990 990,1290 1290,1740
There's one other {} process

1947
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,180
0,180 180,300 300,930 960,1500 1530,1590
that is important to be

1948
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:21,140
0,270 270,330 330,510 510,570 570,930
able to call the master

01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,860
0,60 60,870 1050,1860 1860,2430 2430,2520
the coordinator,| {} and the

1951

0,420 420,600 600,960 960,1380 1380,1800

01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,220
0,480 480,570 570,900 900,1260 1260,1620

2146
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,490
0,600 600,1020 1020,1350 1350,1440 1440,1770
And used widely in functional

2147
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:02,170
0,390 390,1020 1140,1350 1350,1500 1500,1680
programming languages,| or any sort

2148
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:03,640
0,60 60,360 360,750 750,1200 1230,1470
of functional programming style,| and

2149
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,680
0,300 300,930 1110,1770 1770,1860 1860,2040
so the basically you know

2150
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,270
0,210 210,390 390,480 480,1380 1380,1590
that's where the inspiration came

2151
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:08,040
0,240
from.|

2152
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:12,120
0,600
Okay?|

2153
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:13,110
0,240 240,450 450,600 600,750 750,930
So actually there's a good

2154
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:14,370
0,210 210,330 330,480 480,660 660,1260
check with two fault tolerance,|

2155
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:17,730
0,810 810,1140 1140,1620 1980,2820 3000,3270
{ -} because the the

2156
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:20,790
0,480 480,840 840,1080 1080,2400 2880,3060
idea is that if a

2157
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:22,220
0,360 360,960
worker fails.|

2158
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:24,020
0,720 780,900 900,1470 1470,1620 1620,1710
Then the coordinators are in

2159
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,220
0,360 360,450 450,960 960,1110 1110,1200
charge of noticing that the

2160
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:27,950
0,270 270,660 660,810 810,1410 1470,2730
worker fails| and basically restarts

2161
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:29,280
0,240 240,810
that task.|

2162
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:32,100
0,330 330,870 900,1020 1020,1860
And so the coordinator

2163
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,900
0,1140
reruns

2164
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,900
0,570 570,660 660,930 930,1500
map and reduce functions.|

2165
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:43,870
0,90 90,270 270,840 840,1290 1290,1530
Of course, coordinator itself doesn't

2166
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,580
0,390 390,600 600,780 780,1200 1200,1710
rerun them,| but basically coordinator

2167
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:46,510
0,90 90,510 510,600 600,690 690,930
to says you know that

2168
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:47,890
0,660 660,870 870,1140 1140,1290 1290,1380
particular map function needs to

2169
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,260
0,150 150,390 390,810 1080,1710 1710,2370
be run again,| because it

2170
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:51,580
0,390 390,480 480,540 540,1140 1140,1320
appears to the coordinator that

2171
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,440
0,480 480,810 810,1170 1170,1680 1680,1860
machine that it handed {you,know}

2172
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,200
0,390 810,1470 1470,1740 1740,2220 2220,2760
the task to actually {}

2173
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,940
0,420 450,780 780,1230 1410,1560 1560,1740
is not responding,| and so

2174
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:59,230
0,390 390,570 570,780 780,990 990,1290
difficult thing is like,| if

2175
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:00,340
0,60 60,360 360,540 540,930 930,1110
the machine doesn't respond to

2176
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,360
0,30 30,270 270,450 450,510 510,1020
some certain amount of time,|

2177
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:02,320
0,210 210,660 660,720 720,840 840,900
the coordinators are going to

2178
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,880
0,270 270,420 420,690 690,1230
assume that machine crashed.|

2179
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:05,980
0,630

2180
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:08,200
0,180 180,570 660,1200 1200,1410 1410,2010
And so, {} and that

2181
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,140
0,480 540,780 780,1260 1260,2070 2190,2940
means {} that { -}

2182
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:13,360
0,360 360,660 660,930 930,1230 1230,1530
when another worker becomes free|

2183
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,350
0,270 270,390 390,510 510,750 750,990
and {you,know} was looking for

2184
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,060
0,240 270,600 600,1200 1410,1590 1590,1710
a new task| and it

2185
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:17,140
0,150 150,390 390,570 570,780 780,1080
will hand out the same

2186
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,310
0,360 360,480 480,600 600,930 930,1170
task that had actually handed

2187
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:19,810
0,150 150,600 600,720 720,1380 1380,1500
out earlier and handed out

2188
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:20,640
0,270
again.|

2189
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,540
0,540 540,660 660,780 780,930 930,1080
{} And so that's sort

2190
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:23,560
0,60 60,150 150,450 450,720 720,1020
of the basic plan {for,fault}

2191
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,810
0,570 600,870 870,1170 1350,2010 2010,2250
tolerance is that,| {} if

2192
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:27,610
0,570 570,840 840,1080 1080,1110 1110,1800
coordinators here about {} particular

2193
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:31,030
0,1020 1830,2310 2310,2730 2730,3180 3180,3420
{} worker reporting back the

2194
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:32,380
0,390 390,450 450,810 990,1170 1170,1350
task is done| and we'll

2195
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:34,120
0,360 360,420 420,840 870,1230
rerun the task again.|

2196
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:35,380
0,150 150,210 210,480 480,810 810,1200
So an instant question is

2197
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:36,940
0,240 240,450 450,510 510,780 780,1440
like can a map function,

2198
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,890
0,480 480,510 510,750 750,960 960,1530
get a map run twice,|

2199
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:43,140
0,180 180,270 270,600 600,1080
and even complete twice,|

2200
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,390
0,120 120,210 210,780 810,1050 1050,1230
is it possible in this

2201
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:52,800
0,510 510,750 750,840 840,1230 1230,1410
framework,| that you know a

2202
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,780
0,690 690,1080 1080,1230 1230,1410 1410,1980
particular mapper will run twice.|

2203
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:57,530
0,180 180,480 480,600 660,1020 1020,1680
I guess it is,| because

2204
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:59,360
0,360 450,780 780,1200 1200,1440 1440,1830
if the machine is down,|

2205
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,240
0,120 120,360 360,660 660,1170
you can't really tell

2206
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,530
0,210 210,420 420,780 780,1140 1140,1290
{} at which point,| so

2207
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:04,320
0,180 180,480 480,630 630,1110
how many of the

2208
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,750
0,450 510,1080 1080,1620 1620,1890 2010,2250
{} map tasks that it

2209
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,410
0,810 1230,1950 1950,2070 2070,2610 2610,2970

2210
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:12,600
0,330 330,870 900,1200 1200,1650 1650,2190
-} instance were actually completed,|

2211
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,680
0,180 180,300 300,480 510,810 810,1080
so you would just have

2212
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,810
0,360 810,1290 1320,1830 1830,1980 1980,2130
to {} run all of

2213
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:16,980
0,210 210,300 300,690
them, I guess.|

2214
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,750
0,240 240,1440 1440,1590 1590,2190 2190,2310
Yeah, yeah, so mostly we

2215
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:20,590
0,150 150,270 270,480 480,600 600,840
just think about this one

2216
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:21,730
0,300 300,390 390,450 450,840 840,1140
task at a time,| but

2217
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,860
0,360 360,990 1080,1560 1560,1950 1950,2100
{} so machine like that

2218
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:25,300
0,180 180,660 660,1080 1080,1260 1260,1440
one task then goes back

2219
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:26,230
0,90 90,150 150,630 630,840 840,930
to the coordinator asked for

2220
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:27,250
0,60 60,330 330,780 810,900 900,1020
the next task| and that

2221
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:28,420
0,150 150,240 240,480 480,720 720,1170
might be another map task.|

2222
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,040
0,390 390,570 570,690 690,900 900,1080
{} And so when the

2223
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:31,810
0,360 360,570 570,1020 1020,1140 1140,1590
coordinater doesn't hear your back,|

2224
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:33,010
0,180 180,270 270,480 480,660 660,1020
it will say like okay

2225
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,150
0,270 270,480 480,750 750,1020 1020,1110
go ask another worker to

2226
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:35,650
0,540 540,720 720,930 930,1200 1200,1500
run that map test too,|

2227
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:36,340
0,180 180,240 240,390 390,480 480,570
but it could be the

2228
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:37,450
0,330 330,540 540,750 750,900 900,1110
case that is you point

2229
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:39,550
0,450 450,720 720,900 900,1170 1530,2100
exactly out,| that the first

2230
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:41,290
0,690 690,780 780,990 990,1500 1530,1710
worker the first machine didn't

2231
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:42,600
0,270 270,900
actually crash.|

2232
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,380
0,180 180,360 360,600 600,660 660,780
{} Just happen to be

0,60 60,360 360,810 810,990 990,1140
a network petition or like

2234
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,630
0,90 90,330 330,810 810,930 930,1110
the word coordinator was not

2235

0,420 450,660 660,1140 1140,1320 1320,1500
machine,| but actually it's just

2237
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,010
0,270 270,660 660,750 750,960 960,1110
running happily and actually doing

01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:51,390
0,90 90,330 330,750 1110,1290 1290,1380
the map task,| and it

2239
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,350
0,90 90,480 480,570 570,840 840,960
can produce you know an

0,540 540,690 690,780 780,1380
intermediate set of results.|

0,570 660,900 900,990 990,1230 1230,1470
{} So the same map

2242
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:57,730
0,330 330,660 660,1080 1080,1260 1260,1800

01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:01,750
0,300 300,390 390,480 480,1140 1170,1260
one of the reasons you

2245
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:02,800
0,120 120,300 300,540 540,900 900,1050
know that {mapreduce -} or

2246
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,290
0,720 990,1170 1170,1590 1590,1860 1860,2490
functional is,| because that's okay

2247
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:06,730
0,300 300,510 510,570 570,960 960,1440
if it's a functional program,|

2248
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,110
0,270 270,420 420,720 720,810 810,1350
if you run the same

2249
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:09,970
0,630 690,870 870,930 930,1320 1320,1860
program on the same input,|

2250
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,320
0,270 270,390 390,540 540,600 600,960
if you run a functional

2251
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,670
0,480 480,600 600,690 690,990 990,1350
program on the same input,|

2252
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:13,750
0,120 120,240 240,480 480,990 990,1080
it will produce exactly the

2253
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:14,840
0,240 240,690
same output.|

2254
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,130
0,90 90,270 270,510 510,1110 1140,1290
So there's really matter that

2255
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:17,510
0,150 150,360 360,900 930,1050 1050,1380
it runs twice,| you know

2256
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:19,610
0,330 420,780 780,1140 1140,1710 1740,2100
in both cases were produced

2257
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,560
0,630 630,690 690,960 960,1440
exactly the same output.|

2258
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:23,000
0,150 150,270 270,480 480,690 690,1230
And so this is where

2259
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,890
0,420 420,930 930,1410 1410,1500 1500,1710
this functional aspect is actually

2260
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:26,660
0,240 240,840
really important.|

2261
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:27,410
0,150 150,420 420,510 510,600 600,690
It basically has to be

2262
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:29,360
0,420 420,480 480,1320
functional or deterministic.|

2263
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,430
0,150 150,390 390,690 690,1110 1140,1350
You see every run of

2264
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:35,540
0,120 120,570 570,780 780,1050 1050,1110
this {map,function} must produce the

2265
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,710
0,240 240,660 660,930 930,1050 1050,1170
same output,| because we're going

2266
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:37,610
0,60 60,240 240,480 480,570 570,900
to use one of them

2267
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:40,310
0,300 300,750 750,870 870,1470 2160,2490
{} into the total total

2268
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:41,440
0,540
computation.|

2269
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:43,840
0,150 150,480 480,660 660,960 960,1260
So similar, can reduce function

2270
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,080
0,180 180,690
run twice?|

2271
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,380
0,780 780,840 840,1110 1110,1530 2040,2460
Yes, I believe so.| Yep,

2272
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:03,580
0,510 510,600 600,660 660,840 840,1170
exactly for the same reason,|

2273
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,170
0,30 30,630 630,780 780,1140 1140,1530
I mean the machine runs

2274
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,700
0,390 390,720 720,840 840,990 990,1260
reduce function is no different

2275
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:07,900
0,90 90,150 150,390 390,810 810,1200
than {} map task,| there's

2276
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:08,980
0,210 210,390 390,570 570,660 660,1080
really no from the {fault,tolerance}

2277
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,210
0,420 420,570 570,720 720,990 990,1230
perspective,| there's no really big

2278
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:11,440
0,300 300,570 570,630 630,930 930,1230
difference between a map task

2279
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,630
0,150 150,420 420,870 1140,1890 1920,2190
and reduce task,| if the

2280
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,250
0,390 390,720 720,810 810,1140 1140,1620
machine running the reduce task

2281
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:17,920
0,840 840,1200 1200,1620 1620,2040 2040,2370
doesn't report back,| but happens

2282
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,390
0,120 120,480 480,750 990,1350 1350,1470
to also will finish the

2283
01:12:19,390 --> 01:12:21,070
0,480 510,840 840,1110 1110,1500 1500,1680
job,| another machine {might,run} be

2284
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,330
0,240 240,690 690,780 780,990 990,1260
running exactly the same reduce

2285
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:23,100
0,330
function.|

2286
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,320
0,150 150,360 360,540 540,810 810,1260
And they will produce output.|

2287
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:26,880
0,150 150,330 330,690 690,870 870,990
Now the only sort of

2288
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,500
0,420 420,930 930,1110 1230,1530 1530,1620
interesting aspect in this is|

2289
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,360
0,450 450,990 1020,1350 1350,1680 1680,1860
that both reduce function will

2290
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,010
0,360 360,480 480,780 780,1380 1380,1650
write {you,know} an intermediate will

2291
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:33,690
0,270 270,630 660,1020 1020,1410 1410,1680
write the final output file

2292

0,270 270,1020
into GFS.|

2293
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:36,920
0,330 330,420 420,810 840,1230 1230,1620
And if you paid attention

2294
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,210
0,180 180,390 690,900 900,1020 1020,1290
to it,| you will notice

0,120 120,300 300,510 510,810 810,960
that what they what they

0,180 180,330 330,630 630,780 780,1110
do is| actually they first

2297
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,540
0,420 420,510 510,1020 1020,1170 1170,1260
produce the file in an

file system,| and then do

01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:45,420
0,90 90,570 570,1050
an atomic rename,|

0,90 90,150 150,390 390,690 690,1080
of the two reduce functions

0,240 240,330 330,450 450,510 510,780
because they're going to produce

01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:04,140
0,420 420,510 510,750 750,1170 1170,1410
exactly the same outcome,| because

2312
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:05,220
0,150 150,570
they're functional.|

2313

0,210 210,300 300,720 720,930 930,1200
have a machine that's doing

0,510 600,930 930,1080 1080,1230 1230,1410
single machine can do like

0,540 780,1050 1050,1320 1320,1440 1440,1650
multiple map tasks,| so let's

2319
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:17,710
0,120 120,270 270,420 420,660 660,840
say that it's doing like

2320
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:19,870
0,390 570,960 960,1410 1620,1980 1980,2160
10 map tasks| and it's

2321
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:21,520

0,150 150,240 240,450 450,690 690,870
then for some reason it

0,570 720,840 840,960 960,1020 1020,1350

0,120 120,210 210,420 420,510 510,660

0,180 180,660 780,1140 1140,1380 1380,1650

0,240 240,600 600,750 750,1080 1080,1560

0,360 360,540 540,660 660,870 870,990

2449
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:04,040
0,360 360,510 510,570 570,750 750,1350

2452
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:09,700
0,240 240,510 510,600 600,750 750,810
see when we go to

2453
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,930
0,480 480,750 750,900 900,960 960,1230

0,90 90,270 270,360 360,780 780,840

0,330 330,780 780,1140 1140,1350 1560,2220
the coordinator actually just basically

2458
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:18,730
0,270 270,330 330,660 660,1260 1260,1470
runs a second instance,| or

2459
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:20,080
0,270 270,540 540,870 870,960 960,1350
maybe third instance of that

2460
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,610
0,480 480,720 720,810 810,1110 1110,1530
task on a separate machine.|

2461
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,070
0,120 120,210 210,510 510,810 810,990
And it's totally okay,| that's

2462
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:24,030
0,300 300,480 480,570 570,720 720,960
totally okay to do so,

2463
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:25,710
0,270 270,510 510,810 810,1440 1560,1680
correct,| because it's functional,| so

2464
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:27,300
0,150 180,1050 1050,1380 1380,1500 1500,1590
it's no problem if we

2465
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,130
0,210 210,270 270,480 480,1230 1500,1830
run the same computation {}

2466
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:30,420
0,300 300,690 690,930 930,990 990,1290
several times,| because the {it,will,reduce}

2467
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:31,740
0,120 120,240 240,630 630,720 720,1320
we use exactly the same

2468
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,030
0,330 330,630 630,900 900,1020 1020,1230
same output,| because it's given

2469
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:35,250
0,60 60,300 300,690 840,1710 1710,2220
the same input| {} and

2470
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:36,570
0,210 210,450 450,600 600,780 780,1140
the hope is that one

2471
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:38,100
0,90 90,210 210,420 420,1050 1050,1530
of these other guys will

2472
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:40,530
0,660 720,1440 1530,2010 2010,2220 2220,2340
finish quickly,| {} and so

2473
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:41,940
0,420 420,630 630,900 900,1110 1110,1410
therefore, then we were not

2474
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,020
0,90 90,420 420,510 510,720 720,1080
the performer is not limited

2475
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:45,420
0,240 240,990 990,1440 1680,1920 1920,2400
by {the,slowest} worker,| but basically

2476
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:46,650
0,300 300,780 780,840 840,960 960,1230
the fastest are the ones

2477
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:47,900
0,120 120,270 270,780
that got replicated.|

2478
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,170
0,120 120,240 240,420 420,540 540,690
And so this is only

2479
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,940
0,180 180,420 540,1110 1110,1470 1470,1770
one of {} issues,| where

2480
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:52,990
0,360 360,720 720,870 870,990 990,1050
like basically this is a

2481
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:54,760
0,360 360,900 1110,1410 1410,1650 1650,1770
common idea to deal with

0,600 600,690 690,900 900,1020 1020,1200
stragglers| to deal with tail

2483
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,820
0,600 750,1110 1110,1440 1440,1650 1650,1860
latency,| {} is to try

2484
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:00,910
0,1020 1050,1410 1410,1890 1890,2430 2670,3090
to basically replicate tasks {}|

2485
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:03,040
0,810 840,1140 1140,1320 1320,1680 1710,2130
and go for the first

2486
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,180
0,150 150,720
that finishes.|

2487
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,470
0,720 840,1140 1140,1260 1260,1710 1710,1890
{} Okay, I think this

2488
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:11,610
0,90 90,300 300,570 570,810 810,1140
is time to wrap up,|

2489
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,230

2490
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,540
0,150 150,270 270,720 720,1320 1620,2310

0,120 120,270 270,360 360,450 450,510
but these are some of

2492
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,640
0,90 90,390 390,900 960,1350 1350,1560
